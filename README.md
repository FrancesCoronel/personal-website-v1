## Installation

Install [Ruby & Bundler](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll/) if you haven't already.

Use the following commands to locally serve this website.

```bash
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Make sure to update your gems every now and then!

```bash
bundle update
```

For faster rendering...

```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve --watch --limit_posts 1
```

If you aren't running the latest version:

```bash
gem update jekyll
```

To convert multiple HTML files to Markdown:

```bash
for f in *.html; do pandoc ${f} -f html -t markdown -s -o ${f}.md; done
```

To convert Wordpress.com XML files to Jekyll format:

```ruby
ruby -rubygems -e 'require "jekyll-import";
JekyllImport::Importers::WordpressDotCom.run({
    "source" => "fvcproductions.wordpress.2017-03-04.002.xml",
    "no_fetch_images" => true,
    "assets_folder" => "assets"
})'
```

I use CodeKit 3 (`config.codekit3`) to handle compilation.

## Usage

This website was created from the bottom-up and is a migration from my Wordpress website at [`fvcproductions.wordpress.com`](https://fvcproductions.wordpress.com).

## Contributing

I am always looking for ways to make my website more modular, lean, and clean.

So if you have any suggestions, please feel free to contribute!
