<blockquote class="embedly-card"><h4><a href="https://fvcproductions.com/portfolio/2016/01/31/life-at-home/">FVCproductions üçì</a></h4><p>For Hoya Hacks 2016, I was unable to physically travel to the hackathon location at Georgetown University. My team was okay with me working remote though, so I just collaborated with them (mostly just Jamison though) virtually through the hackathon's Slack channel.</p></blockquote>
