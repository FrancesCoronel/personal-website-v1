## About

STARS (Students & Technology in Academia, Research & Service) Computing Corps is a community of practice for student-led regional engagement as a means to broaden participation in computing.

The STARS celebration showcases current STARS participants and STARS alumni, as well as industry and community partners.

Celebration provides opportunities for learning, collaborating, and networking with academic and industry partners.

I attended with other students from Hampton University.
