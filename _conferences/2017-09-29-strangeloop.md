## Wednesday, September 27th

My plane departed from San Francisco to St Louis around 10:30 am and arrived around 4:30 pm (there's a two hour time difference).

There were quite a few Strange Loopers and even Ian<sup>[1](#footnote1)</sup> was on my flight.

Upon arriving, I got a Lyft to my Airbnb which was ideally located very close to downtown.

I never ended up meeting my Airbnb host but her dog, Rizzo, who is a black lab mix, was there the whole time and so I played around with her for a bit before resting and getting ready to attend my first Strange Loop event.

### Unofficial Strange Loop Event: Mozilla Developer Roadshow

So Strange Loop itself is a major conference that has grown to the point that there are even [unofficial events](//www.thestrangeloop.com/unofficial-events.html) that happen beforehand.

{% include figure url="//img.evbuc.com/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.evbuc.com%2Fimages%2F34806650%2F72481470389%2F1%2Foriginal.jpg?w=1000&rect=0%2C0%2C10834%2C5417&s=0f310628a1b4506fdb7b2ad358f5e556" title="What Makes the Web Work" %}

The first of these unofficial events was the [Mozilla Developer Roadshow](//www.eventbrite.com/e/mozilla-developer-roadshow-presents-what-makes-the-web-work-tickets-37377977537?utm_campaign=order_confirmation_email&utm_medium=email&ref=eemailordconf&utm_source=eb_email&utm_term=eventname) which was presented by both Mozilla and Launch Code.

I really enjoyed this event not just for the speakers but because it felt very personal.

#### Takeaways

- Realized I actually knew a lot already about security and privacy on the web
- Learned a lot more about Mozilla's efforts to create a better and open web and became super impressed
- Inspired to learn WebGL because the last speaker created very cool graphics

## Thursday, September 28th

Today was all about pre-conference activities.

{% include figure url="//www.elm-conf.us/favicon.png" title="Elm Conf" %}

I decided to attend [Elm Conf](//www.elm-conf.us/) since I have zilch experience with functional programming and I figured it would be interesting to learn something way out of my element.

I researched prior that it's possible to check in to a hotel earlier than the standard check-in time. Your room just has to be ready. So I checked around 11 am if my room was ready and it had just be cleaned.

I scurried over to my room and settled down.

Later that day, I ended up getting interviewed by the marvelous Kim Crayton on my thoughts regarding diversity in tech.

This was fun and even though this my first ever interaction with live video/Periscope, I felt quite relaxed.

The rest of the night was spent watching talks at the hotel and preparing for my Lightning Talk tomorrow.

## Friday, September 29th

The first official day of the conference!!

I spent the bulk of today listening to talks and prepping for my own talk again.

### Project Alloy Sponsor Chat

Around lunch, Project Alloy, the organization that helped fund my ticket, had a Meetup dedicated to grantees and sponsors.

This was quite fun as I got to meet fellow Project Alloy grantees.

### Project Alloy Meetup && #INCLUDE <ALL>: An Unofficial Strange Loop Event

The final Project Alloy event happened concurrently

This was an event sponsored by Netflix that was going on con-currently with the Project Include Meetup.

I ended up taking a photo with two other grantees that I met at Strange Loop and thought were really cool.

### Lightning Talks

Out of the 26 talks submitted to be a Strange Loop Lightning Talk, 12 were selected through popular vote.

My talk was selected and I was able to present the first Lightning Talk starting at 8:30 pm in the Grand Ballroom EF.

{% include figure url="//i.imgur.com/vHCJVfY.png" title="Lightning Talks" %}

My talk was called **"TypeScript 101"**.

I got a lot of great feedback on it too!

<blockquote class="embedly-card"><h4><a href="//twitter.com/JQiu25/status/913982900906979333">Julie Qiu on Twitter</a></h4><p>Excited to try out @typescriptlang after hearing @fvcproductions's lightning talk. Thanks for the class! #strangeloop</p></blockquote>

## Saturday, September 30th

More talks!

My favorite talks were on art and inequality, both at the Peabody.

My boyfriend actually ended up getting a little jelly because I mentioned that Adam Savage was going to be the closing Keynote speaker. It was a pretty great talk...

## Sunday, October 1st

Waking up super early to catch a flight home. 😴️
