> No, but really - this means a lot. Let me explain.

You see, the Bureau of Labor reported in 2016 that women made up only 25 percent of computing-related occupations.

And when looking at women of color like myself, the numbers become even more ridiculously dismal with Latinas and Black women holding only 1% and 3% of computing jobs, respectively.

## ...okay, that's great. But what's the big deal?

Well, first, let me also provide some context.

Most people know that a **unicorn** is defined as a startup company valued at over $1 billion. The term was coined because the chances of a startup becoming a unicorn are very statistically rare (about `1.28%` likely to happen). 🦄️

This means that according to those standards, I'm quite literally a **"unicorn"** in the sense that I'm part of the 1% of Latinas that considers herself a die-hard software engineer. A maker. A creator, not a consumer. 🛠️

Now I became aware of this isolation so long ago and have since developed a strong desire to want to motivate and aid those who want to enter the tech field but may not feel like they'll fit in. 😢️

💛️ **With your support**, I become closer to reaching my goal in becoming a leader in the tech field in order to inspire others who grew up looking like me and show them that yes, Latinas can indeed code and lead within the tech industry. *In any industry, really.*
