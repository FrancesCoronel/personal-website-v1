A Little GRE
I have an alacrity to design AI someday, but I fear my mindset is much too prosaic at times.

Therefore, I‚Äôll speak out with with veracity that I have the paucity of an appropriate background.

I maintain then the fact that I feel terribly contrite.

I, being an laconic individual, have suffered from my pugnacious guardians who are as disparate as night and day.
