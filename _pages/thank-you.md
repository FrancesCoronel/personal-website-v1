## You just made my day! ðŸŽ‰

As I eventually come across your generous donation, I canâ€™t tell you how much I appreciate your support for the work I've done across many mediums, whether it be through development, designs, writing, or anything else - I appreciate it a lot!

So once again, thank you for your donation.

Here's a virtual hug. It's not much, but it *is* a really cute `GIF`.
