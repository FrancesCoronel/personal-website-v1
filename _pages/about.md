<h2>I like to dabble with things that <del>shouldn‚Äôt</del> ought to be dabbled with.</h2>

Might have something to do with human nature in general, though, so interpret it as you will.

**Fun Fact** My logo is a chocolate dipped strawberry. No particular reason why, I just think they're yummy. üçì üç´
