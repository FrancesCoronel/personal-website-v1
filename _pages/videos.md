I Wish
- video that showcases people in different scenarios saying “I wish…” then depending on their claim, the video switches to a scenario with a different person where that same wish has been fulfilled. Repeat process.
- For example:
    - says the nerd “I wish I were popular like her"
    - says the pop star “I wish I were skinnier like her"
    - says the skinny girl “I wish were stronger like him"
    - says the football player “I wish I were more clever guy like him"
    - says clever guy “I wish I were more reserved"
    - says reserved guy as he’s getting beaten up “I wish I were dead"
    - says dead guy “I wish I were alive"
- and then as the video is revolving around these wishes - the scene cuts and robots are presented in a room known as “The Machinery"
- in a monotone angelic like voice they point out the flaws of their fellow human beings in history and how they do not wish but just are
- “We do not need wishing for we simply are"
