## Graduate Programs - MBA/MSCS

This list provides graduate programs that offer a dual degree in an MBA and Master’s in Computer Science/Robotics/AI/related – which are of course, few and far.

MBAs will include any type: executive, part-time, international, etc.

MSCSs will include research specializations in: general computer science, machine learning, genetic algorithms, strong AI, robotics, and so on.

Anyone is welcome to contact me and contribute to this list.
