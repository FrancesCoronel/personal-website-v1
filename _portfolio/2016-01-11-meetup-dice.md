Overview

Meetup Dice - Winner

Check out the web app at [`meetfvc.herokuapp.com`](https://meetfvc.herokuapp.com).
-----------------

So for my [Norfolk.js Meetup group](https://meetup.com/NorfolkJS), they
like to give out prizes through a raffle every
[Meetup](https://meetup.com). The method they used was messy with a
simple console application (I think). Anyway, I just wanted a better
visual experience for choosing a random person to give a prize to.

Right now, unfortunately, this web app just works for the Meetup groups
I’m a part of but eventually, I’d like to be able to use the [Meetup
API](https://www.meetup.com/meetup_api/) to get it to work for anybody’s
Meetup profile.

#### Full credit goes to the contributors below who originally created the app. It had a pretty rough layout though so I made a lot of visual changes.
