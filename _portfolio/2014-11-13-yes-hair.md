Overview
========

I was put in charge of some of the online branding and website for
`Yes Hair`, a group aiming toÂ promote minority beauty through hair
products.

> This project was completed inÂ `November 2014` for the Yes Hair
> committee at Hampton University.

*Disclaimer: The project has since been discontinued.*
