Overview
========

I collaborated in a four-person team to create an e-commerce store that
specializes in selling robots with features such as multi-tenancy,
admin/merchant dashboards, and social login using [the MEAN
stack](https://mean.io "MEAN stack"), [the Mandrill
API](https://mandrillapp.com/api/docs/ "Mandrill API"), and
[OAuth](https://oauth.net/ "OAuth").

> This project was completed on `August 5th, 2015` for the Stackstore
> phase of Fullstack Academy.

Features
--------

-   multi-tenancy available so users can add their own stores
-   admin dashboard allows admins to manage users, products, orders,
    categories, and reviews
-   merchant dashboard allows user merchants to manage the same things
    as admin except they cannot manage users and have the opportunity to
    customize the appearance of their store using SCSS
-   Mandrill API was integrated to send emails to the users to reset
    their password, requesting to be a merchant, approving a merchant
    request, and order status
-   oAuth was utilized for 3rd party login/signup integrations with
    Facebook, Google+, and Twitter
-   shopping cart persists across various states of web app
-   guest users can check out but only logged in users can leave reviews
