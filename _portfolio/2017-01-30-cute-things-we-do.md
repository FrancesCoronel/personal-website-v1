My boyfriend and I hope to take on clients in the future as part of our
new freelancing initiative - **Cute Things We Do**.

We came up with the idea last year and decided to go forward starting in
2017.

**Cute Things We Do** is a collaboration between Frances Coronel
(myself) and Nolan Kovacik (my boyfriend).

Feel free to check out our starting website at https://cutethingswedo.com
