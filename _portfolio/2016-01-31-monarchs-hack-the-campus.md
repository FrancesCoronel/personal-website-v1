For an upcoming hackathon at [ODU](https://odu.edu) dubbed
[`Monarchs Hack the Campus`](https://www.cs.odu.edu/~acm/hackathon/), I'm
acting as a volunteer and am already helping out with some pretty big
tasks.

### Tasks

-   branding
    -   created 4 new banners using Sketch and existing logo (credits to
        Michelle Graham for the logo)
-   the actual website
    -   **completely redesigned** from the bottom up to have a nice look
        and feel based on an HTML5UP template
-   registration
    -   redesigned and made some minor changes to the configuration for
        the Typeform used as registration for those interested in
        attending the hackathon
