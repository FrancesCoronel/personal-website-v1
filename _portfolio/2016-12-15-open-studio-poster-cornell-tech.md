Every fall, leading startups, companies, and organizations in NYC pose
business challenges to Cornell Tech.

In Product Studio, teams develop and present new products, services, and
strategies that respond to those challenges.

Our team responded to **The New York Times (Community)** challenge: *How
might we create a safe place for people of all backgrounds to discuss
important local, national, and global issues?*

To address this problem, we created Q&A, a platform that solicits the
opinion of readers based off of both the text analysis of an article and
their personal reading history.

At the end of the semester, each team was also tasked to create a poster
for their community challenge teams in order to display them at Open
Studio.

## This is the end result.
