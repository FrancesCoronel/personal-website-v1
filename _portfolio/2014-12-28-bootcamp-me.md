The world is teeming with coding bootcamps, but I just couldn’t find a
more geographically/visually oriented website that showed all the
physical coding bootcamps that are available out there.

In comes [**Bootcamp.me**](https://bit.ly/bootcampme "Bootcamp.me"), a
Google map that provides links to in-person coding bootcamps/development
schools located worldwide.

I also created a crowd-sourced version of the map using the service
[Mapme](https://mapme.com/ "Mapme").

> I began working on this project on **November 8, 2014**.
