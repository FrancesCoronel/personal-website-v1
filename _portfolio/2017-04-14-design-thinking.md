## I took a design thinking course at Cornell Tech

For my Design Thinking class at Cornell Tech, my team - **Ohana** - came up with the final project of **PathFinder**.

### Point of View Summary

*we met...* potential college students who are overwhelmed with the possibilities of their future

*we were amazed to realize...* how little transparency there is into different educational or career paths

*it would be game changing if we...* could provide a way for students to look into the future and make more educated decisions about what their next steps should be
