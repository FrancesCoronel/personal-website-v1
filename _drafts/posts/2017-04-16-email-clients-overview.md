I've always been somewhat obsessed with keeping up with the latest and greatest productivity tools, so naturally I've looked into some email clients.

Here's a quick blurb into why I haven't been satisfied.

My current solution is **Mail (default macOS client) + MailButler**.

## Polymail

- star functionality missing?

## Canary

- UI not intuitive enough

## Spark

- not enough features

## Airmail

- too many lists created

## Inbox

- love but does not accept multiple clients

## Nylas Mail

- love but so damn slow!!
- cannot setup Exchange account

## Postbox

- difficult to setup
- seeing flagged emails is not as easy to do
