Questions to Ask

How do you go from screenwriter to PM? Unique background?

- understanding people, picking up on their queues, their tells, product management theres a lot of people stuff
- communicate & undestand
- without offending people
- lead them
- emphatize

When you're faced with a feature that only 8% of your user base is using, you have to make a call: Kill it or keep it.

Have you ever been in this kind of situation before?

cost to having a feature
engineering needs to maintain it
customer support
keeps users happy
attracts customers
preventing from leaving
leads to referrals
--> getting you publicity

2% of your users
very high cost to serve
not making referrals
not important to growth strategy
not worth to keep feature alive
ROI analysis

Why did you move from engineering to PM?

- studied engineering
- leave many doors open
- considered everything from investment banking to consulting to engineering to PM
- build by talking with customers and putting together the requirements and working with engineers
- shepherding with customers and how its helps the customers and build the business
- bite-sized project to allow an intern to run with it
- get help with resources in company
- rely heavily on feedback and

What is the biggest advantage of having a engineering background? What about biggest disadvantage?

- coming up with the ideas
- shipping
- level of nuance that's required when it comes to engineering and make efficient use of our time
- deep understanding of how software works than make better ideas
- as an engineer, better to have deep critical thinking when it comes to math
- numbers games

What do you wish you'd known as an engineer that you now know as a PM?

How do you earn the respect of the engineering team?

read code & talk down to me
get questioned a lot more than others
dont have an MBA background
	poking holes in projects in differnet ways - simlar to engineers
flesh that out - risk adverse**

wireframes in Balsamiq - do things in Sketch - make rules that dont exist in your product - understanding platform on engineering and business sides

what questions will people end up asking

who they know

2 more questions -- i saw that you use slack and you mentioned sketch- what else do you use on a daily basis

Slack, Sketch, Google Sheets (love/hate), Google Docs, all the Google stuff, I hate Google Drive, data tools - Aleft (database queries using SQL), Calendly, InVision,

- do your job
- responsible for writing very detailed specs
- defend roadmaps and product map
- feel included in the decision
- get ideas of their team
- technical enough to have a technical question

What aspects of product management do you find least interesting and why?

corraling - more stakeholders - everyone needs to know everything but if you let everyone know everything - they dont read anything

lots of reminding people - not reminding but informing people of updates

give you correct feedback so it doesnt blowup later

read updates - keeping people informed

so many projects going on at one time - hard for people to keep up

- project management
    - varying degrees
    - break work down into chunks
    - getting chunks done on time
    - being accountable to dates
    - paper jockeying and coordinating between people
    - engineers should be responsible for their team

PM Prioritization

pricing comes up earlier --> think about business

office supply company
move into the digital age
blackboards - white boards
how do you

    * 3 major components to product
        * What do we build?
            * vision of company (long-term)
        * How does it work? (PM Intern focused on)
            * know problem that is worth solving
            * getting engineers involved (constraints & feasibility)
        * How do we ship it?
            * shipping features
            * making products go quickly

- If you're a PM, you make decisions about your product - what features to develop, when to develop them, how to get users to start using those features, etc.
- When planning your roadmap and where you team should spend their time, it's useful to ask "how many people are actually using each of our product's features?"
    - a simple way is by plotting out all the features on two axes: how many people use a feature and how often
￼

Deciding For New Features

1. Does it fit your vision?
2. Will it still matter in 5 years?
3. Will everyone benefit from it?
4. Will it improve on an existing workflow
5. Does it grow the business
6. Will it generate new meaningful engagement
7. If it does well, can we support/afford it
8. Can it be designed so reward is greater than effort
9. Can we do it well
10. Can we scope it well

Rolling Out New Features

1. Team testing (dog-fooding)
2. Company testing
3. Restricted beta
    1. Discoverability
    2. Engagement
    3. Adoption
    4. Use Cases
    5. Barriers
4. Full roll out
    1. Message schedule for feature
    2. continuous built-in notifications as you use app

￼
￼
- The reality is that typical feature usage is usually limited to a few key ones and the rest are barely used
- For any feature with limited adoption, you can kill it, try to increase adoption rate, try to increase frequency, or just try and make it better

PMs have to be good at saying "no"

- Building a great product isn't about adding a ton of useful features that are somewhat related
- But instead delivering a cohesive product within well defined parameters
- Potential bad excuses:
    - data looks good
        - takes very little time
        - certain customer going to quit
        - make it optional
        - cousin's neighbor said
        - nothing else planned
        - we can work on whatever we want
        - but x amount of people want it
        - but competitors have it
        - but someone else will build it
        - but boss wants it
        - could be the one

Why I'm Better

Having a solid engineering background gives a PM two critical tools: the ability to relate to engineers and a grasp of the technical details driving the product

Gusto Values with Jarell

Questions to Ask

- Which value of Gusto do you identify with the most?
- The least?
- For value 02 (don't optimize for the short-term), how do you relate to this - where do you see yourself in the future or 5 years from now?
- How would you define a PMM?
    - best understanding of the customer that you find - what motivates them - know the customer inside out
    - trends in space
    - eyes & ears in competitive landscape
    - handful of buckets: 1) customer research feedback loop to product, what things they need to change, 2) go-to-market strategy, customer segmentation, market sizes, projections over time, and 3) partner to PMs when it comes to launching features - how do we launch? how do we find out about it
    - on-boarding flow - custom docs
- What aspects of product marketing management do you find least interesting and why?
    - lots of project management
    - wrangling of different stakeholders
    - other folks on marketing team
    - coordination
- love most: longitudinal - deeper on long-term projects - customer search, segmentation,

Gusto

""Travis’s biggest strength is that he will run through a wall to accomplish his goals," said Mark Cuban, the Dallas Mavericks owner and billionaire investor who has mentored Mr. Kalanick. "Travis’s biggest weakness is that he will run through a wall to accomplish his goals. That’s the best way to describe him.""

At the core of every single one of the problems we face as a society is the total lack of social ethics used by businesses. Uber is just another example of fundamentally-unethical business practices in the way both customers and workforce are used.

I'm so tired of alpha males. And alpha females. I don't want to "lean in", conquer the world, grind people's faces into the dust if they're 10 minutes late, act like a frat boy for my whole life. or make billions and billions and billions of dollars. It sounds like a horrible life, but these over achievers with under developed consciences, just keep making our world worse and worse. Couldn't they all go to some survivor island and eat each other alive?

Kalanick illustrates that having a great idea and being a CEO are two very different skill sets. The idea behind Uber is a good one....his ability to be an effective CEO is very questionable.

Hila

Imagine that you are the PM working on this new feature. We want to build a new feature. Every time an employee gets paid, we want to send an email.

Combination between

Users didn't really know they wanted

Customer customer support case

No existing framework notifying employees that they've been paid
