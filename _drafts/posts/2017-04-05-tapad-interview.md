You’ll see it again and again (and again).  What’s up with the computer science requirement for PMs?

Coding isn’t a regular part of a PM's regular job, so why don’t companies loosen up that requirement to find someone who's truly excellent at the core product management skills?

Here’s the simple answer: Many people without a background in computer science can’t form a strong working relationship with engineers.

All of those excellent product management skills will go to waste if the PM alienates his engineers and can’t earn their respect. Product Management is a job where you have to lead without authority.  The only way to get great work done is to bring the team onboard with your vision.

It’s possible to be a great PM without a technical background, but you’ll need to find a way to build a strong relationship with your engineering team and work past the hazards that non technical people so often hit.

At the heart of the product network is the product itself. The Product, in a software company, literally consists of code deployed to an environment where people can access it.  All products are connected to three things: developers, users, and a business.

Developers (or engineers) are the people who can write and deploy code. Companies usually have people working on the product that aren’t programming, but the people updating the code are the only folks on the team who are strictly necessary. Developers can perform all company duties (while not always effectively).

Users (or, less broadly, "customers") are the people who either use the product or might use the product. All products have the goal of being used, on some level, by people.

The Business is the entity that funds and hopes to benefit (e.g. profit) from the product. Whether the organization is for-profit or non-profit, there is a bank with a finite amount of funds.

A product manager is at the center of design, tech, and business. Define the market and customer, define the problem and value propositions, define requirements and roadmaps, evangelize and champion product, evaluate competitors.

Product management is an important organizational role typically in a technology company. The product manager is often considered the CEO of the product and is responsible for the strategy, roadmap, and feature definition for that product or product line.

The role of product management spans many activities from strategic to tactical and at its best provides cross-functional leadership — bridging gaps within the company between different functions, most notably between engineering-oriented teams, sales and marketing, and support.

The top 10% of product managers excel at a few of these things. The top 1% excel at most or all of them:
1.
* Think big - A 1% PM's thinking won't be constrained by the resources available to them today or today's market environment. They'll describe large disruptive opportunities, and develop concrete plans for how to take advantage of them.
* Communicate - A 1% PM can make a case that is impossible to refute or ignore. They'll use data appropriately, when available, but they'll also tap into other biases, beliefs, and triggers that can convince the powers that be to part with headcount, money, or other resources and then get out of the way.
* Simplify - A 1% PM knows how to get 80% of the value out of any feature or project with 20% of the effort. They do so repeatedly, launching more and achieving compounding effects for the product or business.
* Prioritize - A 1% PM knows how to sequence projects. They balance quick wins vs. platform investments appropriately. They balance offense and defense projects appropriately. Offense projects are ones that grow the business. Defense projects are ones that protect and remove drag on the business (operations, reducing technical debt, fixing bugs, etc.).
* Forecast and measure - A 1% PM is able to forecast the approximate benefit of a project, and can do so efficiently by applying past experience and leveraging comparable benchmarks. They also measure benefit once projects are launched, and factor those learnings into their future prioritization and forecasts.
* Execute - A 1% PM grinds it out. They do whatever is necessary to ship. They recognize no specific bounds to the scope of their role. As necessary, they recruit, they produce buttons, they do bizdev, they escalate, they tussle with internal counsel, they *.
* Understand technical trade-offs - A 1% PM does not need to have a CS degree. They do need to be able to roughly understand the technical complexity of the features they put on the backlog, without any costing input from devs. They should partner with devs to make the right technical trade-offs (i.e. compromise).
* Understand good design - A 1% PM doesn't have to be a designer, but they should appreciate great design and be able to distinguish it from good design. They should also be able to articulate the difference to their design counterparts, or at least articulate directions to pursue to go from good to great.
* Write effective copy - A 1% PM should be able to write concise copy that gets the job done. They should understand that each additional word they write dilutes the value of the previous ones. They should spend time and energy trying to find the perfect words for key copy (button labels, nav, calls-to-action, etc.), not just words that will suffice.

I'm not sure I've ever met a 1% PM, certainly not one that I identified as such prior to hiring. Instead of trying to hire one, you're better off trying to hire a 10% PM who strives to develop and improve along these dimensions.
