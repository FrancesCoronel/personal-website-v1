Binti

* foster care agencies are suffering from much worse IT than found in private sector
* Binti is selling agency tools that is supposed to increase their productivity
* Binti is allowing foster care agencies to approve more foster applications faster which is addressing the shortage of foster homes
* Binti aims to be compliant with federal standards
* Binti aims in getting more homes online to address the shortage
* Binti also aims to elevate low moral among caseworkers
* Binti's sales people showcase Binti as a way to reduce time spent on casework which will allow the agency to reallocate staff and regain subsidies
* Binti uses a variety of techniques for reaching the right people like leveraging SF to start a campaign in CA since SF staff know a lot of agencies
    * use geography -- cold outbound over phone -- administrator -- we're already working with your neighbor two counties away 
    * talk about --> delighting earlier customers is key
    * early customers are sharing good things about the product
* users: social workers + approval workers (all they do is approve families) + clerical/probation teams --> permissions 
* foster families are able to apply online --> collaborate
* privacy leaks -> field has sort of settled on HIPPA as a framework of securing systems
* 9 people --> HIPPA compliance --> not trying to pave new ground by trying to utilize work of other companies --> leaning heavily on Google --> secure cloud --> HIPPA apps --> Google proprietary software --> HIPPA minded software & founders --> full time devops & security person
* LA was our first agency that has sub agencies --> aggressive timeline --> 100 different systems --> legacy system 
* SF had used Excel --> master spreadsheet --> they try 1 or 2 vendors every year
* CaseCommons --> non-profit custom software development for states and counties and cities
* 712K in revenue for 2017, big discounts for early customers --> need to charge more --> 50% of subsidies came from gov. 
* asked for a daily refresh in Binti from state databases 
* training libraries --> video documentation --> say hi to check in on them
* customer support --> ETO, Social Solutions, Mora --> company that Tera used to work for --> Social Solutions --> gen. purpose software used to overview workers
* field populated at the policy & social science level that we only need to end up bringing the tech
