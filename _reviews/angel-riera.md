I donâ€™t know if you remember me but we Skyped a while ago. You were nice enough to let me ask you questions and get [advice on the application process](https://fvcproductions.com/2016/03/31/all-the-bootcamp-things/) for [Fullstack](https://fullstackacademy.com). I went into the admissions process with way more confidence and I got in!

So thank you, you were extremely helpful.

## Update

It's Angel! First day of Senior Phase at Fullstack. It's been crazy as hell, but I've learned so much in the past six weeks. Thanks again for all the help!
