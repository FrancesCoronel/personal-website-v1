So there's this book that covers the best study strategies.

I read it for fun since it was in my local library and it looked pretty
interesting so I decided to go ahead and share the key points.

I originally made this list February 21, 2014.

When there are so many time-consuming distractions out there, it's much
more effective to know how to correctly manage all your precious
mili-seconds.

So most top colleges have this central message that the book seems to
hold as its main idea as well

#### If you wanna play hard, you gotta work hard.

You know, something along those lines...

***So anyhow, the book starts off with study basics‚Ä¶***

1. **Start off the day using 5 minutes to manage your time**
    -   Jot down to-dos and deadlines on a physical/electronic list
        whenever they arise (I use Evernote)
    -   Transfer to-dos and deadlines to a calendar
        (physical/electronic) in morning (I use iCal)
    -   Plan day with realistic time frames
    -   Move what you don't have time for to a different date
2. **Defeat Procrastination**
    -   Keep note of progress with work through small notebook/task list
        (:idea: Evernote's work great for this)
    -   Record if tasks were successfully accomplished and if not, note
        why not
    -   When working, eat healthy snacks to maximize energy
    -   Transform boring study tasks into a big deal to have max
        starting energy
    -   Build work routines to make steady progress, not all out bursts
    -   Choose your hard working days to minimize stress impact
3. **The When, Where, How**
    -   Try to fit in as many mini tasks as possible between classes
    -   Study in isolation without distraction
    -   Take a small break every hour
    -   Morning and afternoon are ideal times for work, not the evening

¬†

***Then the book looks at different ways to tackle weekly or daily
quizzes and exams‚Ä¶***

1. **Take Smart Notes**
    -   Always go to class and try to take the best notes possible
    -   Quality over Quantity
    -   For nontechnical courses (humanities) focus on capturing big
        ideas by taking notes in a sort of question/evidence/conclusion
        format
    -   For technical courses (STEM) focus on recording as many sample
        problems and answers as possible
2. **Demote Assignments**
    -   Work a little bit each day on your assignments
    -   Avoid suffering from day-before syndrome! It's dangerous.
    -   Read only the favored reading sources on the syllabus in more
        detail
    -   To decide how much time to spend on supplemental sources, follow
        this guideline
        -   readings that make an argument are more important than
        -   readings that describe an event or person, which are more
            important than
        -   readings that only provide context (speech transcripts,
            press clippings)
    -   Take reading notes in the question/evidence/conclusion format
3. **Utilize your resources**
    -   Figure out exactly what the test will cover (either through the
        teacher, syllabus, etc.)
    -   For nontechnical courses, make sure to cluster your notes in an
        organized manner
    -   For technical courses, build mega-problem sets to practice with
        and make sure they mock what the exam would look like
4.  **Conquer Material**
    -   Embrace quiz-and-recall method - very efficient (:idea: Quizlet
        helped me a ton with this sort of thing)
    -   Spread out memorization over several days
5.  **Invest in "Academic Disaster Insurance"**
    -   Eliminate the question marks for topics covered in class or from
        the reading that you don't understand
    -   In other words, if you don't understand something, figure it out
        using other resources, or start focusing more on the other
        topics so you at least have more leverage
6.  **Provide "A+" Answers**
    -   Look over the whole test first
    -   If you get stuck on a problem and still can't think of anything
        after 10 seconds, SKIP IT, and move on
    -   Figure out how much time you have to spend on each question,
        making sure that you focus on the most valuable questions first
    -   Leave time at the end of the test to check and recheck your work
    -   Answer the questions in order of increasing difficulty
    -   Write out a mini-outline before tackling an essay question

*SO BASICALLY* focus on the easiest, most valuable questions that you
understand first and then go in increasing difficulty to the rest of the
problems‚Ä¶*baddabing baddaboom*

***Finally the book focused on how to effectively write essays and
papers‚Ä¶***

1. **Target a Titillating Topic**
    -   Start looking for an interesting topic early
2. **Conduct a Thesis-Hunting Expedition**
    -   Start with general sources and then follow references to find
        more targeted sources where good thesis ideas often hide
3. **Seek a Second Opinion**
    -   A thesis is not a thesis until the professor has approved it
4.  **Research like a Machine**
    -   Find sources
    -   Make personal copies of all sources
    -   Annotate the material
5.  **Craft a Powerful Story**
    -   There is no shortcut to developing a well-balanced and
        easy-to-follow argument
    -   Dedicate a good deal of thought over time to getting it right
    -   Describe your argument in a topic-level outline
    -   Type supporting quotes from sources directly into your outline
6.  **Consult Your Expert Panel**
    -   Before starting to write, get some opinions on the essay from
        friends and family who are familiar with the material
    -   The more important the paper, the more people who should review
        it
7.  **Write Without the Agony**
    -   Follow your outline and articulate your points clearly
    -   Try not to write no more than 3- 5 pages per weekday or 5 - 8
        days per weekend day
8.  **Fix, Don't Fixate**
    -   Read paper carefully on your laptop to make sure your argument
        is clear, fix obvious errors, and rewrite where the flow needs
        improvement
    -   Use built-in or online error-finding applications or software to
        make sure you don't miss anything
    -   Carefully read out loud a printed copy of your paper, marking
        any awkward passages or unclear explanations
    -   A final pass over a printed version of the paper to check the
        overall flow and to root out any remaining errors

If you don't recall any of this stuff, try to remember that no student
should have to study and work all day, sleep for 3 hours, and go through
the amount of stereotyped head ache and stress society assigns to the
typical college student.

Also, if you feel anything you're doing could be completed
automatically, either by an intelligent algorithm currently online or a
cyborg/intelligent algorithm in the **NEAR** future, try to avoid doing
more of that, or [you're probably not gonna have a job
later](//www.economist.com/news/briefing/21594264-previous-technological-innovation-has-always-delivered-more-long-run-employment-not-less "Economist Article on Tech Replacing People").

**It is VERY possible to complete all the necessary school work while
getting all the sleep you need and managing extracurriculars, family,
and friends.¬†**

You just have to be a little bit clever.

**Work hard, play hard.** üòÅ

Credits for the study strategies go to author of the book, **Mr.
Newport**.
