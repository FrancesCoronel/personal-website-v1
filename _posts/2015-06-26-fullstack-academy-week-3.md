Day One - Monday
----------------

-   My feelings on FQL represented by an emotive - 😐
-   Really enjoyed the lecture on `Promises` today. The partner I worked
    with (Nirmohi) was really in sync with how I worked.
-   Looking forward to more promises being made. Hehe. 😋



Day Two - Tuesday
-----------------

-   The `twitter-js` project was fun, but this `twitter-sql` business is
    just a whole nother ballgame, and I'm not sure if I really like
    playing… ⚾️⚾️⚾️
-   On the other hand, `Mongo` seems nice. The docs are definitely
    cleaner…



Day Three - Wednesday
---------------------

-   I actually tried doing exercise in the morning by going to the
    swimming pool with my Tia Ceci. It was fun and all, but it
    definitely requires more effort so I'll probably just do that sort
    of thing once a week.
-   Really want to share that presentation (the one featuring all the
    cool web dev stuff) soon - but I'm going to hold off until I've made
    a few more tweaks.
-   The workshop went really well today - got a good partner and
    progress was made.
-   There was a brief alumni panel today as well and I'm pretty
    impressed that this one alumnus is already going to be working on
    [Dropbox](//dropbox.com "Dropbox") even though his cohort
    graduated in April (?)(*somewhere around that time*) of this year.
    -   Basically what my conclusion was from the panel is to make sure
        to work on **side projects** and **prepare appropriately** for
        the hiring stages/white board interviews.
    -   I do have experience with white board interviews and they are
        quite scary. However, I don't blame most companies for keeping
        that strategy since it is pretty hard coming up with effective
        methods to truly test the ability of able programmers.
    -   💡I really like what [**Aline
        Lerner**](//blog.alinelerner.com/ "Aline Lerner's Blog")
        has to say in general about technical recruiting since she also
        feels the same way I do in regards to resumes being pretty
        ineffective for evaluating programming skills.



Day Four - Thursday
-------------------

-   The testing process for our Wikistack project of yesterday was much
    less exciting, but at least I didn't struggle horribly with it and
    consequently get the urge of sinking into some deep dark hole.
-   For the third (?) time at Fullstack, I get food from some place
    other than Lenny's.
    -   So naturally I screw it up by ordering a bloody *personal pan*
        pizza instead of just getting those jumbo slices all the NYC
        pizza places are used to selling. The wait is at least 15
        minutes as they customize my cheese pizza to satisfy one person.
        Lesson learned. 🍕
    -   Given that I am just now realizing that I strongly prefer
        stability when it comes to my food, I can suppose Fullstack is
        just forcing me to rediscover my true relationship with food.
        Although it might also just be because Lenny's just has a lot of
        Latino workers.
-   🍴 My learning team lunch today involved playing this board game that
    featured a lady with a big bust for the cover.

Avalon Set Up

-   Set in the primitive medieval era,
    [Avalon](//www.amazon.com/Indie-Boards-Cards-AVA1IBC-Resistance/dp/B009SAAV0C "Avalon")
    forces people to lie and identify as either a good or bad person,
    which has never made sense to me (not just the good vs bad
    schematic, but the whole light vs dark color theming, etc.) because
    I've always identified as both a good and bad person.
    -   Regardless, the game was a lot of fun because it involves the
        wicked art of *deception* and people just made a bunch of
        accusations all throughout which led to a lot of laughter and
        random banter.
    -   I myself don't feel I'm terribly good at lying, but people have
        told me before that I have a great poker face or that I'm just
        plain shady. *The quiet ones are always a little crazzyyyy…*
    -   Anyways, the good people (such as myself) won, but only because
        the bad kids weren't very good at being bad. Shucks.



Day Five - Friday
-----------------

-   Shoot, today was a mad race against time.
-   In other words, it was a crazy day, but the good kind of crazy.
-   My little team and I had to solve these different programming
    puzzles that related both to the [American Museum of Natural
    History](//www.amnh.org/) and to our instructors.
-   I don't want to spoil anything, but the great part about the first
    half of today was that I felt a lot like [Robert
    Langdon](//www.wikiwand.com/en/Robert_Langdon "Robert Langdon")
    running around all these historically relevant places with some hot
    chick constantly solving puzzles/riddles and figuring out where the
    next clue will lead him.
    -   Of course, in my case there wasn't any hot chick and the only
        location I was running around in was the museum itself, but
        hey - that museum is **exceptionally** large.
    -   I mean, could you guess the Latin name of this dino? ![Duck Bill
        Dino](//www.amnh.org/var/ezflow_site/storage/images/media/amnh/images/exhibitions/permanent-exhibitions/fossil-halls/hall-of-ornithischian-dinosaurs2/duck-billed-dinosaur/149935-1-eng-US/duck-billed-dinosaur_dynamic_lead_slide.jpg)
    -   **Exactly.**
-   After that whole warp back in time was over and done with, I had
    lunch with Kelsey and Jovia at this yummy vegetarian place. This is
    when I finally found out that same sex marriage is finally legal
    **EVERYWHERE**. WOOT WOOT!!!

[![Pride
Octocat](//fvcproductions.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/pride-octocat.png)](//fvcproductions.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/pride-octocat.png)

-   Once all was said and done and we headed back to Fullstack, I was
    very full and tired, so the lecture on Promises didn't get the
    attention it deserved from me.
-   Thankfully though, afterwards, by some freakish and questionable
    miracle, I'm not struggling with the workshop that much at all.
    *Mmmhmmm.*
-   The last thing of the day of course is 🔥 **Hot Seat🔥** and once
    again I find myself most delighted by the stories of my fellow
    peers.
-   Good times.
