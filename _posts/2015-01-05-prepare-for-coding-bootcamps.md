date: 2014-01-05
excerpt: "Before my interviews with all the coding bootcamps I applied to, I did some digging and really went out of my way to try and find out what would make me a better candidate in the entire process."

**How are students selected?**
------------------------------

### There are 2 main ideas behind selection.

![](//www.javatpoint.com/images/javascript/javascript_logo.png)

**1. You have a basic working knowledge of JavaScript fundamentals.**

-   They judge you on how you think, not what you know
    -   How willing are you to learn?
    -   What is your potential to succeed?
    -   Can you demonstrate the aptitude to pick up simple concepts?
    -   Have you learned a reasonable amount of JavaScript on your own?
-   Their ability to teach you is very important
    -   You should not be afraid to ask questions (be honest about your
        weaknesses).
    -   \^ No such thing as stupid questions.
    -   Have a positive attitude under pressure.
-   Synonyms that come up to describe the ideal student
    -   `warm`, `smart`, `driven`, `compassionate`, `capable`,
        `friendly`, `dedicated`
-   You don't have to be expert coder, but a good learner.

**2. You are a good fit for the program.**

-   Culture fit is vital in the interview process
    -   They want to make sure everyone gets along (so show your best
        self).
    -   You're fun to hang out
    -   You do not ring any alarm bells (ergo, not an asshole).
    -   There are \~30 applicants for each student, but it is important
        to note that qualified applicants typically underestimate
        themselves and reputation
    -   Your formal education and previous job success does not matter,
        only your ability to code



**How do I prepare?**

*The Gist Of It*

> You will go through a pair programming interview process that
> (usually) pushes you beyond your comfort zone (in terms of
> programming, hehe).

**Helpful Resources**

- [coderbyte](//coderbyte.com/CodingArea/Challenges/ "Coderbyte Easy") -
    the easy challenges
- [Codecademy](//www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/javascript "Codecademy") -
    the JavaScript track
- [Code
    School](//www.codeschool.com/paths/javascript "Code School") -
    the `Road to JavaScript`
- [Eloquent JavaScript: 2nd
    Edition](//eloquentjavascript.net "Eloquent JavaScript") -
    basically reading the whole book would be helpful, but if you can't
    do that, then the 1st 5 chapters are pretty key

**Going All Out**

- [JavaScript: The Good
    Parts](//www.amazon.com/JavaScript-Good-Parts-Douglas-Crockford/dp/0596517742 "JavaScript: The Good Parts") -
    the first few chapters
- [Functional
    JavaScript](//shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920028857.do "Functional JavaScript") -
    again, the first few chapters

**Topics that are generally NOT covered in the interview**

-   jQuery
-   regular expressions
-   AJAX
-   node.js
-   HTML/CSS

**Topics that CAN be covered in the interview**

-   plain old JavaScript
-   callbacks (passing functions as arguments to other functions)
-   how anonymous functions and functions are stored in variables as
    callback arguments
-   iteration through collections
-   variable declarations, function signatures, if loops, conditionals
-   built in array and string functions
-   underscore JS functions
-   RECURSION (yes, seriously, inception)

#### **Really Getting Down to The Nitty Gritty**

-   What arguments are provided to each function, and what are their
    types?
-   What gets returned out of a function, if anything?
-   How and when do you use anonymous functions?
-   What does it mean to be a higher-order function, and how are they
    composed?

#### **Potential Problem**

-   Create an array of numbers, save it to a variable
-   Use a loop to iterate through each element of the array
-   Write a separate "doubling" function that returns any number it is
    given multiplied by two
-   Pass each number from the array to the "doubling" function in turn
-   Save the original numbers and the doubled results as key-value pairs
    in an object



Recently, SwitchUp released their 2014 list of the [top coding
bootcamps](//fvcproductions.com/blog/2015/02/20/brief-thoughts-best-bootcamps-switchup/ "Brief Thoughts on SwitchUp's Review for 31 Best Bootcamps 2014 💭").
I'd check that out too.

For finding them, refer to this post [where I look over the best
websites for that
purpose](//fvcproductions.com/blog/2014/12/27/a-short-operation-tips-tricks-4-coding-bootcamps/ "A Short Operation: Tips & Tricks 4 Finding Coding Bootcamps 🔎") and
also the post where I [elaborate on
each](//fvcproductions.com/blog/2014/11/10/magnifying-the-bootcamp-research-experience/ "Magnifying the Bootcamp Research Experience 🔎").

I also have shared my **interview experience** with bootcamps such as
