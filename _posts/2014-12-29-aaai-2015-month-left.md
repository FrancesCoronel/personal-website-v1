Holy crap, I just got my plane ticket for this.
===============================================

It's happening.

do the Bender danceâ€¦



I'll be acting as a volunteer for [the
conference](//www.aaai.org/Conferences/AAAI/aaai15.php "AAAI 2015 Winter Conference")
(it's the first winter conference, too, apparently) and was therefore
lucky enough to get a \$200 scholarship and a complimentary registration
(\$450, in my case) to attend.

\$200 is very little to cover travel and hotel costs, but seeing as I
have no serious research experience in the field yet, I'd say I'm still
fine with it. Especially considering these registration costs for a
student AAAI member like myselfâ€¦

> **Student AAAI Member (Registration Fees)**
>
> - Early: \$450
>
> - Late: \$550
>
> - Onsite: \$600

I mean, *HOLY CRAP*! My bank account would cry if it had to deal with
such costs on top of flight and travel.

Hotel costs, even with the special conference rate, will beÂ \~\$1087 out
of my pocket. And then flight costs ended up being \~\$358. And then of
course, there are other expenses to consider such as food and possible
incurring extra travel costs. Either way, it's probably going to cost me
roughly \$1.5K not including the \$200 scholarship they gave me. Ah,
well. Hopefully, it'll be worth it! See lovely flight details below.

I'll take the very back window seat please, thanks.

Thankfully, with a scholarship I got from the
[VSGC](//vsgc.odu.edu "VSGC @ ODU"), I'll be able to pay off the
majority of these conference fees. **Whew.** In the end, I'll be
shelling out only \$300 for it all, which isn't terrible. Glad I'm
selling so much crap on eBay, I'll tell you that.

I will say though that I don't feel I really have a lot of information
yet in terms of scheduling.

I mean, I just know the basics as of right nowâ€¦
