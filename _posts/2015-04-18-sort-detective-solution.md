Files Provided To You
---------------------

-   `SortDetective.jar`, which looks something like this:

> The purpose of this little HW assignment is to correctly identify the
> 6 Greek letters (Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Epsilon, & Zeta) with
> their matching sorting method (selection, insertion, bubble, quick,
> merge, & heap sort).



Step 1 - Download JD-GUI
------------------------

Head over to the Java Decompiler [page located at
`jd.benow.ca`](//jd.benow.ca/ "Java Decompiler")) and download the
`ZIP` file for the `JD-GUI`.

Step 2 - Launch JD-GUI
----------------------

Now that you've downloaded the `ZIP` file, unzip it and launch the
application.

Step 3 - Open your `SortDetective.jar` file using `JD-GUI`
----------------------------------------------------------

Step 4 - Find the Formula That Determines The Order
===================================================

`SortDetective.jar` determines the sorting method ordering according to
your student ID.

It has an array defined with **5 different** orders that the sorting
methods **CAN** be placed in. See `Line 256` in the
`SortDetective.class`.

Zooming in…

![](//fvcproductions.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/screenshot-2015-04-18-16-09-09.png)

With some minor searches, we find out that the method `experimentOrders`
uses the variable `selectedPermutation` to determine what array value it
will use to determine the order.

This redirects us to the `setStudentID()` method. So now we've figured
out the ordering all just depends on the formula the program uses.

Step 5 - Apply Formula To `experimentOrders`
--------------------------------------------

So, in my case, my student ID is `00319124`.

Using the formula, we can determine that the value of
`selectedPermutation` is going to be `2` for me since `319124` / `10` %
`5`= `2.4` or simply `2` for `int`. That means that the array value for
`experimentOrders` will be `2`, making a match to the order found on
`Line 7` when zooming in to `Line 256` in `SortDetective.class`.

Remember, arrays are ordered like `{0,1,2}`. So `experimentOrders[2]`
would be the 3rd value in the array.

There we go! Just like that, I now know for sure that the ordering of
the Greek letters for me would go

-   Alpha - Quick Sort
-   Beta - Selection Sort
-   Gamma - Merge Sort
-   Delta - Bubble Sort
-   Epsilon - Insertion Sort
-   Zeta - Heap Sort



### Good luck with your HW! :wink:
