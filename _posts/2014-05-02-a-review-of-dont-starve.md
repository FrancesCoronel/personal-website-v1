So in case you haven't heard of it yet, "[Don't
Starve](//www.dontstarvegame.com)" is this awesome Indie game that
came out late April of last year.

A year into its inception, I gotta say that I'm really glad how amazing
it's turned out - high aggregate and review scores - and they've
recently added their first paid downloadable content expansion called
"Don't Starve: Reign of Giants", which basically added a bunch of new
monsters (giants, perhaps?) and territory to discover and be terrorized
by.

I think the first time I saw this game back in June last year, I was
kind of hesitant. The
[trailer](//www.youtube.com/watch?v=W689SOpXG9o) didn't really
impress me that much and it looked like I was just going to be walking
around a lot and not divulging in as much excitement as I would like.

Let me point out though that the [trailer for their newest
expansion](//www.youtube.com/watch?v=btI6Eyqv01c) is pretty
downright nifty. Probably because they combined animation with the
gameplay to create that creepy atmosphere that makes the game so
special.

Any whoozies, once I got into the game, I found that I was genuinely
scared for my character's (Wilson) livelihood. And that was amazing! To
feel emotionally connected to any character in the game is a win-win,
right? The gamer feels the adrenaline pumping through their body and the
developer can be satisfied knowing that the gamer really was entertained
and moved. And what with Wilson's famous
[beard](//dont-starve-game.wikia.com/wiki/Beard), it's hard NOT to
like the guy.

In the game, for example, there's a clock that will alert you as to when
it is the morning, afternoon, evening, and then midnight (there are even
seasons), which is the darkest hour and you basically can't see crap.
AND you will come to realize that in the game, things definitely go bump
in the night, if you know what I'm mean.

There's also different structures and magical tools you can construct
with the proper amount of material. Build a house or fortress, create a
magical dark sword, cook a wonderful [meat
souffl√©](//dont-starve-game.wikia.com/wiki/Meat) (something along
those lines). It's really your call, which converts to many fun hours of
random gameplay.

My first time playing the game, I thought I was all good. I mean, I got
my food, my materials - everything was JUST dandy. BUT then I realized
oh wait, it's getting close to midnight, what does that mean?! It means
I friggin' died just because a stupid spider killed me when I couldn't
see anything but pure pitch darkness.

Be prepared to die in this game, a lot. Unless you're really into
survival games. Then you're probably just going to die a few times.

For a game that looks like something pulled out of Frankenweenie (the
developers were inspired by Tim Burton after all) , they make sure to be
consistently in touch with reality - you'll get hungry pretty fast, you
can become insane (and I mean who wouldn't if they were stuck in the
wilderness with all these [f'ed up
creatures](//dont-starve-game.wikia.com/wiki/Monsters)?), you can
get sick, and so on. By the way, if you're going to look at how the
monsters look like, consider yourself spoiled because it's much better
to have them scare you in real time.

Regardless, even the constant string of deaths, which are actually
preventable with the [right
ingredients](//dont-starve-game.wikia.com/wiki/Meat_Effigy),
couldn't stop my utter fascination with the overall ominous ambiance of
the game. I mean, not only does it take a long time to just discover
everything the game has to offer with the multiple characters, adventure
mode, story mode, all the sweet monsters and the strange societies they
belong to, etc., but once you do discover them, you want to take a
moment to sit back and just kind of appreciate the little fellas for the
scary buggers they are.

So **THANK YOU** Klein Entertainment for providing a great Indie game.

Obviously my personal rating is going to end up as a 5/5 or 10/10 - what
have you.

Also, it doesn't hurt that the game has awesome fanart. Check it out.

Isn't Wilson just downright adorable?

There's many ways to play this game and so there are many ways to fall
in love with it.

Indeed, I'll be starving today once again. Cheers.
