So after realizing a lot of people liked the idea of a more
geographically oriented way to find a bootcamp, I started creating
[Bootcamp.me](//bit.ly/bootcampme "Bootcamp.me") using Google Maps
back in November of last year.\[googlemaps
//www.google.com/maps/d/embed?mid=zIblKEWM9BnY.kF6pHtgPUlIo&w=640&h=480\]

Again, you can find the Google Map at [bit.ly/bootcampme](//bit.ly/bootcampme "Bootcamp.me").

As of right now, there are exactly [165 distinct
bootcamps](//bit.ly/bootcamps-to-add "Bootcamp Directory") on the
map, which is *pretty* awesome. I mean, it's only been 3 years and
there's already so many! Says a lot.

It's also really cool seeing where they are popping up, which is
practically **everywhere**, but there are definitely some clusters here
and there.

Anyhow, after some thought, I decided to go ahead and begin a
crowdsourced version of the map using
[Mapme](//mapme.com "Map.me"), an Israel based startup that allows
users to develop - surprise, surprise - crowdsourced maps.

Mapme | Coding Bootcamps

You can find this work in progress at [mapme.com/coding-bootcamps](//mapme.com/coding-bootcamps "Mapme | Coding Bootcamps").
---------------------------------

This is partly because I know I'm not going to be able to update this
project at some point in the future due to other priorities so better to
have it updated constantly by everybody instead of me alone.

Now I'm not **completely** switching over to this map quite yet. Mapme
is still a work in progress being a startup themselves so the app isn't
quite refined yet. It's nice, however, that I was able to get early
access. It's obvious they're dedicated to quality over quantity right
now.

**For the time being**, I'll be adding on to the crowdsourced map
**gradually** (I have a lot going on with [Fullstack
Academy](//fullstackacademy.com "Fullstack Academy") right now),
but the Google Map will still act as the main reference, even if it does
lack a bunch of features.

My future goals still involve making this into a full-fledged web app or
having it as a resource for a *coding bootcamp investigator*, as I like
to call them (think [Course
Report](//www.coursereport.com/ "Course Report") and
[SwitchUp](//switchup.org "SwitchUp")). What would they be formally
called anyways?
