So.

[Fullstack Academy](//fullstackacademy.com "Fullstack Academy")‘s
first ever **[Summer of
Code](//www.fullstackacademy.com/summer-of-code "Summer of Code")**
program, which is described as a program that "*gives college students
the opportunity to study full stack web development while on summer
break*" is starting this June.

Specifically, Monday, June 8th 2015.

Ergo, I'm actually going to be part of an inaugural class of
**something**. That's never happened before, so I'm pretty darn excited.

As excited as *I* can get anyway, which to some people would not really
be perceived as very excited at all. Think **[Maurice
Moss](//theitcrowd.wikia.com/wiki/Maurice_Moss "Maurice Moss")**.

Basically.

**Anyhow**, I'm starting to realize that when Fullstack says "intensive
introductory course", they actually do mean an **intensive introductory
course**.

Now I'm a CS major. A senior now too, technically speaking! Yet already
Week 1 of bloody **Foundations** has been neither a jog through the park
nor a slice of pie (*frankly though, I don't enjoy either of those
things anyways*).

Now that may be because my CS curriculum doesn't actually focus on web
development, like most, but still - geez.

**I'm not saying it was ridiculously difficult either.** It was just
more than I expected - I mean, there was **a lot** to do. A lot to get
done. You know, the whole doge thing - *much work, such stress, must
caffeine, alot study* - blah, blah blah.

Mmmmhmmm... indeed...

Now that all sounds bad, but it's only because I'm the kind of person
who was hoping to sit around all month and be lazy before having to
really work my butt off for a full 11 weeks. Mmm…

Well, regardless, I was able to manage. I'm actually quite content with
it all. I feel like I'm learning quite a bit already.

I'm on the border between feeling productive and antsy, because on one
hand I know I'm getting crap done, but on the other, I'm worried about
how much harder it's all going to get. There's also that *teeny tiny
little* fact I'm already aware of about how everybody gets an assessment
their official first week of Fullstack Academy to see if they will still
be continuing on.

Hmmm… tensions rising.
