 excerpt: I
applied to DevLeague, a new coding bootcamp in Hawaii! ---

I decided to apply to DevLeague since they were the first of their kind
in Hawaii. I have some connection with Hawaii. I've actually never been,
but I was initially going to attend [Hawaii Pacific
University](//www.hpu.edu "HPU") as a double major in Computer
Science and Integrated Multimedia with a very large scholarship. Since I
had enough credits from high school, I'd still be able to graduate in 4
years. I even had a party a few months before school started because I
was certain at that point I was going to attend HPU. It was a win-win
situation, but then out of the blue, in July, I got accepted to [Jacobs
University](//www.jacobs-university.de "Jacobs University") with a
medium-sized scholarship and decided to go there for the 3-year CS
program.

> CS so there's that too.



Part 1: The Application 📝
-------------------------

-   You fill out the virtual application for DevLeague
    [here](//www.devleague.com/apply "Apply to DevLeague").
-   Like Fullstack, the application didn't involve a lot of effort, just
    basic background info (employment, coding abilities, cohort choice)
    and two small essay questions. The essay questions are right
    now: `Why would you like to attend DevLeague?` and
    `Tell us a little bit about yourself`.
-   Once you fill this out, they'll send you an email shortly afterwards
    where you will schedule a virtual interview through Skype with one
    of the co-founders,
    [Jason](//twitter.com/sewell_jason "Jason - Twitter").
-   Again, the process overall was clean, efficient, and very organized.
    No problems here.



Part 2: The Interview 📞
-----------------------

    Jason was a great interviewer! All around chill guy and I was comfortable all throughout the interview. He was really informative as well and told me everything I needed to know about DevLeague in great detail. His friend and co-founder of DevLeague, Russel, who was also with him at the time, was also quite amiable.

> answers taken from my interview are paraphrased or just referenced
> verbatim
>
> personal comments are highlighted `like this`



1. **Yield rate - out of the applicants you accept, what percentage end
    up attending?**\

    > It's around 30% and part of that is because we're a very new
    > bootcamp. For 35 students, we had over 115 applications.

2. **How many drop out after simply experiencing the pre-work?**\

    > Well, the coding challenge depending on your knowledge takes 2–4
    > weeks possibly. Pre-work takes roughly 40–80 hours of self-study.\
    > Yeah, people do drop out and it happens very regularly that people
    > don't finish the coding challenge. Fortunately, I don't usually
    > have to make those kind of tough decisions because generally
    > people who don't finish the challenge are the ones that reject
    > themselves. If they're putting time in, then that means they're
    > dedicated to it. I made an exception once because a student felt
    > he had too much work going on and it didn't work out at all.\
    > We try as much as we can to see these things coming - if they need
    > more help, we'll try and help them out. What we have no control is
    > the amount of effort they put in. If it's not a situation that's
    > working out, we do ask them to leave. They have 4 weeks to make a
    > decision for staying in program.

3. **How many college students have you had in the past?**\

    > We get a lot of college graduates actually. We've had a few
    > colleges students. At least a couple. In terms of other students,
    > the backgrounds are all over the place, but they all have the
    > motivation - these are people wanting to make a change
    > professionally.

4.  **What kind of process do your instructors go through?**\

    > They know a little bit of programming, are knowledgable in
    > industry, have multiple projects/multiple systems over many years,
    > and have 10 years or more of professional web development.

5.  **What do you guys recommend students do outside of the course?**\

    > We make our students go to Meetups. Our current cohort is also
    > `highly encouraged` to attend Startup Weekend and 2 of the 3
    > winning teams had members of DevLeague on them. Being proactive is
    > something we encourage. Through collaborating and networking, you
    > never know what kind of experiences you might get out of it - so
    > we kind of put the pressure on our students sometimes. In the end,
    > they're all going to have a website, a couple of projects on
    > GitHub, and an updated LinkedIn profile.
    > `This is a great strategy.`

6.  **If you were my age again (I'm 19), would you still attend a
    bootcamp like DevLeague? Why?**\

    > I think I would, honestly. Getting a degree got me an interview,
    > but most of the success I had was from free-lancing, teaching
    > myself. It's crazy how long it took us to learn all this stuff vs
    > how long it takes people these days - it's just crazy. I wish I
    > had the opportunity to learn that quickly when I was younger.
    > `Truth.`



Part 3: The Decision 💡
----------------------

**I was accepted!!!** Apparently, I did a great job on my coding
challenge (creating a very basic web app) submission and turned it in
well within the timeline. 😁

*Logistics*\
- an initial deposit is required to reserve your seat in the cohort
after you're accepted\
- as the student gets closer to the session start date, payment plans
are put into place
