Honestly, the best blogging utility would be a combination of
[Byword](//bywordapp.com "Byword")'s simple UI, publishing, and
exporting utilities and [Ulysses III](//ulyssesapp.com "Ulysses")'s
database management and the numerous extra features (statistics,
navigation, helpful .md hints, visual syntax, etc.).

It's a real shame when I find this kind of thing out, just how much
greater an app would be if they joined forces with another. I find this
kind of ideal applies to all sorts of great products. It's not a new
concept, but today I've seemed to realize it's implications.

What bothers me even more is that this kind of idea doesn't apply to
just the primitive aspect of app development but governments, non-profit
organizations, etc.

I used to volunteer a lot for *[Operation
Smile](//www.operationsmile.org "Operation Smile")* (from 2009 to
2013), a non-profit organization that provides free surgeries to repair
cleft lip, cleft palate and other facial deformities for children around
the globe. In early 2011, I heard they were going to merge with *[Smile
Train](//www.smiletrain.org "Smile Train")*, the world's largest
charity that provides corrective surgery for children with cleft lips
and palates. Unfortunately, they never did succeed in their merger and
when I asked an employee at OP Smile about it, they explained that their
organizational structures were too different. You can hear more about
the attempted merger
[here](//www.nytimes.com/2011/02/24/business/24smile.html?pagewanted=all "Merger").

Regardlessâ€¦
