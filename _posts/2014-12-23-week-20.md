 So you know how people, when they're blogging, they have that whole *‘Week 1: Hell Week'* and so going on when they're starting something out (like a coding bootcamp)?
========================================================================================================================================================================

Well, given that it'll be roughly 20 weeks before I enroll in whatever
bootcamp I decide to attend, I'm dubbing this post *‘Week –20: As in 20
Weeks Prior'*.



#### Now that we're past clarifications, here's the low down:

-   I wanted to start building stuff for a while now, specifically since
    early May of last year, the month I first started hearing about
    bootcamps when my dad showed me this [Huffington Post
    article](//www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/12/coding-bootcamp_n_3067005.html)
    featuring [Dev Bootcamp](//devbootcamp.com).
-   Last winter in 2013 I literally did the same thing I'm doing now and
    applied to 5 coding bootcamps ([Hackbright
    Academy](//www.hackbrightacademy.com/),
    [HackerYou](//hackeryou.com/), [Bitmaker
    Labs](//bitmakerlabs.com),
    [RefactorU](//www.refactoru.com),
    [RocketU](//rocket-space.com "Rocket U")). I talk a bit more
    about this brief experience and what ended up happening instead
    [here](//fvcproductions.com/blog/2014/10/17/long-lighthearted-lists/#section-bootcamps).
-   **So now, this winter again**, I'm starting over my quest/adventure
    searching for the perfect bootcamp and will hopefully find my
    treasure this time.
-   I even decided to up my game a bit and am in the process of applying
    to 7 bootcamps along with a couple of internships as a backup plan.

-   Anywhoozies, here is what my thought process this time when applying
    for bootcamps:
    1. at least 12 weeks (I want my summer to be spent well given that
        I'm basically free from **May 1 all the way till September 1**!
        I mean, that's roughly 16 weeks!!)
    2. `JavaScript` focused (I never really liked the idea of learning
        Ruby ever since I first tried it out. Plus, I'm more familiar
        with Java and the syntax is similar) or in one case `UI/UX`
        focused
    3. awesome reviews (Ah, derp - for obvious reasons.)
    4.  awesome hiring rate (Even though I'm not looking to be hired
        quite yet, I will be in the near future!!)
-   With that in mind, here's where I decided to apply this time along
    with **one stand out thing** that made me want to apply to the
    bootcamp besides already fulfilling the pre-reqs I set in place and
    also where I am in the admissions process.

1. [Hackreactor](//www.hackreactor.com) (excellent reviews all
    around with great hiring rate) - **interview in January**
2. [Fullstack Academy](//www.fullstackacademy.com) (same as with
    Hackreactor but on East Coast) - **accepted! meeting with founder
    today!**
3. [Makersquare](//www.makersquare.com) (offers housing) -
    **finishing up 2nd coding challenge**
4.  [Coding House](//codinghouse.co) (housing and coding
    combined) - **finished interviews, no feedback yet**
5.  [DevLeague](//www.devleague.com) (first in Hawaii) -
    **interview next Tuesday!**
6.  [Coding Dojo](//www.codingdojo.com) (scholarships abound) -
    **accepted!**
7.  [Designation](//designation.io) (UI/UX immersion) -
    **accepted!**



-   This is just a general overview of my progress so far - I'll be
    having a separate blog entry for each bootcamp and my personal
    experience with it including details from the interviews I had. Each
    bootcamp deserves to be fully reviewed, after all.



Until next time - toodles!
