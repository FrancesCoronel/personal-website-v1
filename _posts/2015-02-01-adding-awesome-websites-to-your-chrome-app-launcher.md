So in your [launcher](//chrome.google.com/webstore/launcher), you have all these lovely links to useful Google Apps and any apps you can find in the Chrome Web Store.
============================================================================================================================================================================

Unfortunately, if you have a website you visit regularly but isn't
available in the Chrome Web Store, there's not much you can do.

You can always use **bookmarks,** but if you're like me, you know too
many bookmarks tend to suck and end up just being a useless clutter of
links you never end up actually benefitting from.

So all in all, it looks like clutter and a ridiculous \# of bookmark
folders are your best options.

**UNLESS YOU COULD ADD YOUR OWN LINKS TO THE APP LAUNCHER.**

**DUN DUN DUN…………………**

Tutorial time.



Things You'll Need
------------------

> icons below were created using this [Pixel Icon
> Generator](//www.iconj.com/pixel_icon_generator.php)

![](//fvcproductions.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/chrome.png)

[Chrome](//www.google.com/chrome/) (derp)

![](//fvcproductions.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/sublime1.png)

[A text editor](//www.sublimetext.com/) (I prefer Sublime Text)

![](//fvcproductions.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/google.png)

[Google-fu](//www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=google-fu)
(Just a little!)



Step 1
======

> Choose which website you want to add! 😍
>
> > I chose [One Page Love](//onepagelove.com/), which is a *One
> > Page* website design gallery showcasing the best *Single Page*
> > website designs from around the web.
> > ![](//fvcproductions.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/one-page-love.png)



Step 2
======

> Create a folder with he name of the site you want to add to your
> Chrome App Launcher.
>
> ![](//fvcproductions.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/folders.png)
>
> > You're going to end up having two files with each folder/app you
> > create:

-   `manifest.json` which holds all the information about your app
-   `.png` file which is going to be a **128x128** icon that will
    represent your website

> > The png can actually be any size, but 128x128 is ideal.
> >
> > You'll need both for this to work (there can be errors!).



Step 3
------

> Open up your text editor and type in the following:

    {
        "manifest_version": 2,

        "name": "One Page Love",

        "description": "One Page Love is a One Page website design gallery showcasing the best Single Page website designs from around the web.",

        "version": "1.0",

        "icons":
        {
            "128": "onepagelove.png"
        },

        "app":
        {
            "urls":
            [
                "//onepagelove.com/"
            ],

            "launch":
            {
                "web_url": "//onepagelove.com/"
            }
        },

        "permissions":
        [
            "unlimitedStorage",
            "notifications"
        ]
    }

> The above example works with the *One Page Love* website.
>
> ![](//fvcproductions.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/screenshot-2015-02-01-19-43-50.png)



Step 4
------

> There are 4 variables you're going to change to work for your website
> in the above code:

-   `name` : site title
-   `description` : site description
-   `128` under `icon` : png file name
-   `urls` under `app` and the `web_url` under `launch` : site url

> > A handy tip to get the description for the website fast is by using
> > the query `info:onepagelove.com` in Google which will provide
> > information about the url. No spaces, or else it doesn't work.
> >
> > ![](//fvcproductions.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/screenshot-2015-02-01-19-51-41.png)



Step 5
------

> Now save this file that you've edited to work with your website as
> `manifest.json` into the folder you created in **Step 2**.



Step 6
------

> Time to get your icon!
>
> > You can accelerate your search by going to `Search tools` &gt;
> > `Size` &gt; `Exactly...` &gt; `Width: 128 px, Height: 128 px` and
> > then by typing in `filetype:png` into the Google search to select
> > specifically for PNG files.
> >

> > ![](//fvcproductions.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/screenshot-2015-02-01-20-16-32.png)



Step 7
------

> You're ready to add the extension!
>
> Head over to `chrome://extensions` or use your toolbar to get there.
>
> > ![](//fvcproductions.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/loading-e1422840256797.png)
>
> Click `Load unpacked extension...`
>
> Choose the folder with your files that you created **Step 4**.



Step 8
------

> Your website will now show up in the extensions!
>
> > ![](//fvcproductions.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/extensions.png)
>
> And once it shows up in your extensions, it'll also show up in the
> `Chrome App Launcher`.
>

> That's it. Congratulations! 😊
