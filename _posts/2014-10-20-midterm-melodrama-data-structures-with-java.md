### Array Properties

-   *overview*
    -   fixed size
    -   more efficient b/c it uses less memory
    -   easier to manage
    -   collection
    -   linear
    -   can add/remove at any position



### Stack Properties

-   *overview*
    -   example of a collection SDT
    -   since stacks are lists, any list implementation will do
    -   Last In, First Out data structure
    -   can be implemented as an array
    -   can only access the top
    -   harder to manage b/c only top can be accessed
-   *defintion*
    -   data structure of ordered items such that items can be inserted
        and removed only at 1 end (called the \[code
        language="java"\]top```)
-   *diagram*![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/29/Data_stack.svg/1280px-Data_stack.svg.png)
-   *conceptual implementation*
    -   First In, First Out (FIFO)
        -   add to rear and remove from front
-   *operations*
    -   ```push``` - adds item to stack
    -   ```pop``` - deletes item from stack
    -   ```peek``` - looks at top item in
        stack
    -   ```size``` - returns \# of elements
        in stack by examining top
    -   ```isEmpty``` - tests for emptiness
        in stack by examining top



### Queue Properties
-   *overview*
    -   example of a collection SDT
    -   operations: enqueue (add), dequeue (delete)
-   *defintion*
    -   data structure of ordered items that can be inserted only at end
        (rear) and removed at other end (front)
-   *diagram*

![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/Data_Queue.svg/1280px-Data_Queue.svg.png)

-   *conceptual implementation*
    -   First In, First Out (FIFO)
        -   add to rear and remove from front
-   *operations*
    -   ```enqueue``` - adds item to queue
    -   ```dequeue``` - removes item from
        queue
    -   ```first``` - looks at top item in
        stack - so front
    -   ```size``` - returns \# of elements
        in queue by examining top
    -   ```isEmpty``` - tests for emptiness
        by examining top



### Stack Code & Algorithms
> *isEmpty*

```int top = -1; //or 0\
public boolean isEmpty () {\
return (top == -1);\
}\
```

> *isFull*

```public boolean isFull() {\
return (top == size-1);\
}\
```

> *add to stack*

```public void add (int element) {\
if (isFull() == true)\
System.out.println("Stack full, cannot add element.");\
else\
stack\[++top\] = element;\
}\
```

1. check if stack is not full
2. set top position of array to element being added to stack
3. increment values of top and count (if partially filled array)

> *delete from stack*

```public int delete () {\
if (isEmpty() == true)\
System.out.println("Stack empty, cannot delete element.");\
else\
return stack\[top--\];\
}\
```

1. check if stack is not empty
2. decrement top
3. set return value to top position of array

> *print in order*

```public void printOrder() {\
while(!isEmpty()) {\
int value = remove();\
System.out.print(value + " ");\
}\
}\
```

> *find an element in stack*

```public boolean find(int element) {\
System.out.print("Please enter element to find: ");\
element = keyboard.nextInt();\
for (int i = 0; i &lt; size; i++) {\
if (stack\[i\] == element)\
return true;\
}\
return false;\
}\
```



### Comparing Stacks & Queues

-   *overview*
    -   stacks and queues are similar data structures
    -   they're different only by how an item is removed first
    -   both can be implemented as arrays or linked lists
-   *advantages*
    -   implementing a stack as an array is easy, but implementing a
        queue as an array is more difficult because you have to dequeue
        from front and enqueue at end
    -   ***TL; DR***
        -   when you want to be able to add or remove values from any
            position, arrays are the way to go because any value can be
            accessed through indexes
-   *disadvantages*
    -   main limitations of arrays is that they cannot be extended or
        shrunk so you want to use an array when you know your max upper
        limit
    -   ***TL; DR***
        -   if you're not sure how many values there will be in your
            data structure, then it's better to not use an array and
            stick with a linked list (ergo, queues) because arrays
            always have a fixed size
-   *examples of stacks*
    -   CD storage case
    -   cafeteria tray
    -   batteries in a flashlight
    -   cars in a single car garage
    -   Towers of Hanoi
-   *examples of queues*
    -   waiting line for a roller coaster
    -   hamburger processing line at Mickey D's
    -   vehicles on a toll bridge
    -   luggage checking machine
    -   phone answering system for most big tech companies



### Queue Algorithms

-   *shift queues*
    -   enqueue operation
        1. save value at first index to item you want to enqueue
        2. increment size
        3. if array fills up, all n elements have to be copied to a
            new, larger array
    -   dequeue operation
        1. save value at first index
        2. shift all elements left
        3. decrement size
-   *circular queues*
    -   advance queue indexes front (to delete an item) and back (to
        insert an item) by moving them both clockwise around array



### Basic Definitions & Phrases

-   *abstract data type*\

    > taken straight from the textbook

    -   a data structure is the underlying programming construct used to
        implement a collection

-   *abstractions*
    -   ignores or hides certain details at certain times, e.g.
        collection is abstraction where details of implementation are
        hidden
-   *"abstract" in abstract data type*
    -   means that there are many different ways of implementing data
        type
-   *algorithm*
    -   step by step instructions on how to execute a program or set of
        instructions
-   *data structure*
    -   memory structure with associated representation mapping, e.g. a
        collection is a type of data structure that acts as an object
        that gathers & organizes other objects
-   *a data type is specified by describing both*
    -   its set of values & operations used for implementation
-   *implementing an abstract data type proceeds in 2 stages*
    -   declaring necessary variables of data types
    -   writing methods & procedures to implement operations of data for
        given data types
