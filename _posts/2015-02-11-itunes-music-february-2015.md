Okay, I've decided to compile all the music from my iTunes library due to sheer boredom.

Okay, I've decided to compile all the music from my iTunes library due to sheer boredom.
========================================================================================



Also, I think it'll be nice to see how much my musical preferences have
changed a few years from now. And it [**will
change**](//www.ted.com/talks/dan_gilbert_you_are_always_changing "Dan Gilbert").

As a general rule with my albums, if an artist has less than 5 songs in
my library, all the songs from that artist are put into a **"Random"**
album, which means they're bunched up with a whole lot of other songs
that fall into a particular genre. Because of this ‘rule', I only have
30 albums but 621 songs, most albums being the ‘Random' ones.

Most of my music falls into one of two genres: `Soundtrack` or `Techno`,
soundtrack music being defined as music I find from any
movie/tv-show/video game and techno music being defined as music I feel
sounds electronic/house/tech like. I generalized all the genres for my
music so it would be easier to categorize.



After some deliberation (about 10 seconds of it), I've decided to go
forward with this post by inserting images of each album showcasing the
songs instead of directly referencing over 600 songs. Could get tedious.

I might come back and manually reference each one, but **NOT TODAY**.

**All the songs I enjoy from the Assassin's Creed games I-IV, which I've
never actually played before.**

One of my all time favorites is `Assassin's Creed III Main Theme.`

**Songs that Calvin Harris worked on.**



**The Classics.**

**These are all just songs from Enrique Iglesias but I just happened to
use the Euphoria album artwork for all it even though these songs all
don't come from that one album.**

I don't think I could ever get tired of `Heartbeat`.

**These songs are great when in the right mood. I actually learned about
Evanescence through my mom because she enjoyed listening to her back
when Evanescence was just starting out. It's a solid album,
regardless.**



**Inception was an awesome experience and I ended up being one of those
crazy people that took the plot too seriously and made up all these
hypothetical scenarios about dream worlds and how I'd probably remain
stuck in one too and my totem would just keep moving about, endlessly
turning and turning.
Mmmmhmmm..**![](//fvcproductions.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/inception.png)

I used to be addicted to Zimmer's `Time`.

**Tidbit: If you watch Interstellar in IMAX, you will feel as if you're
actually floating in space during some parts of the film. **

I like `S.T.A.Y`. the most because that's when everything just came into
place during the film.

**I don't think I could ever tired of the movie Amelie or its beautiful
soundtrack.**

The first time I heard `Comptine d'Un Autre Été` was before I even knew
who Amelie was so when I heard it again in the movie, it just clicked
and I still don't get tired of listening to it.

**I combined the music from the Hobbit series and LOTR series for this
one Lord of the Rings album because well, same difference.**

It was great hearing the Misty Mountains in one of the very trailers for
the Hobbit because finally, it felt like the song was being lifted above
the pages.

**What can I say? The Maze Runner definitely had its moments.**

My favorite from this album is definitely the main
theme: `The Maze Runner`.

**You can't go wrong with POTC. YOU CANNOT.**

**Go Daft Punk, it's your birthday, and you're gonna party like it's
your birthday.**

And cause it's your birthday, you're gonna `lose yourself to dance`
`one more time` `around the world` being
`harder, better, faster, stronger`, just trying to `get lucky` with your
`instant crush` in a `technologic` trance.

**For all you alternatives out there.**

La da di da...

**Dance like there's no tomorrow………………**

Yes, ma Cherie...

**Most of my EPIC music could probably be considered soundtrack as well
or are just in separate albums. Too much epicness to handle sometimes.**

A long time favorite of mine from here is `Nara`.

**To be honest, I'm not that much into indie music unless it's
ridiculously mellow or just sounds kinda like techno.**

//www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3fTw\_D3l10



**Where I go to if I'm trying to workout and feel bummed out. Or just
because.**

//www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsSC2vx7zFQ



**Si, ya tu sabes. Jaja. ;-)**

//www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpLZeSigNvY



**I'm really not much of an oldies fan, but if I'm really in the mood…**

//www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym1eDeOxq14



**I'm actually really not sure if all these songs would necessarily fit
into the ‘Pop' category, but oh well!**



**My very limited R&B selection and again as with Pop, I'm not sure if
these are all ‘R&B' per se.**

`Ice Box` by Omarion is a long time favorite of mine, I have yet to grow
tired of listening to it.

//www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQybgJCswF0



**Tbh, not much into Rock either…**

I could actually probably drop all these songs and be ok with it…



**OMG, soundtrack time!! 3 screenshots needed…**



**And it's now techno's turn… 2 screenshots only this time.**

`Bla Bla Bla` definitely isn't my favorite song from my techno album,
but it has the best music video by far.

**My ‘Random World' album is where I have songs that are not in English
nor en Espanol. I have Albanian, Greek, Hindi/Bollywood, Arabic,
Swedish, Portuguese, French, Iranian, Italian, Belizean, Chinese,
Lebanese, Romanian, and Russian genres mixed up in this one. It's always
nice finding a catchy non-American song.**

**Beam me up, Scotty.**

**Look at that, more epic music. Surprise, surprise.**

I really enjoy `Guardians at the Gate` because it reminds me of the
trailer from **AVATAR**.

//www.youtube.com/watch?v=cRdxXPV9GNQ



**TRON. LEGACY.**

Before I updated my laptop a while back, I actually had 1,000+ plays on
the track `The Son of Flynn`. It was just so soothing/addicting that I
played it when I needed to relax and let go a bit. It had 10 times more
plays than any of my other songs, it was ridiculous. Then again, it is
only 95 seconds long..

**OH MAN. Two Steps From Hell. Seriously though, check these guys out. I
hear them in movie trailers all the bloody time, they're insanely great
at making the epiccesssttt of epic music.**

One of my favorites of theirs is `Heart of Courage`.

**Go XMAS!**

*I'm dreaming of a white Christmas* (in deep voice).

Whew. Okay, enough of this.
