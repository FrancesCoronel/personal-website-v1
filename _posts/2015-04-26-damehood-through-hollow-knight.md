Back in December of last year, I was browsing through Kickstarter - eager to spend my limited college student cash on something awesome.Â I found [Hollow Knight](//www.kickstarter.com/projects/11662585/hollow-knight "Hollow Knight").
----------------------------------------------

So I ended up coming across a project called [Hollow
Knight](//www.kickstarter.com/projects/11662585/hollow-knight "Hollow Knight").
I decided I wasn't ready to commit and told Kickstarter to **Remind Me**
later to see if I still wanted to back up. The video was beyond amazing,
but I was just a little unsure if my 2nd investment on Kickstarter
should be in a 2D game.

Â 

Anyhow, they later email me on December 16, 2015 at 9:02 pm, asking if
I'd still like to help out since their project period was ending soon.

Exactly 25 minutes later, I decide that yes, I'm definitely backing
these guys up.

It was only 10 bucks and you know what, that artwork is to **DIE FOR**.

Also, the video's soundtrack music kind of hypnotized me, beckoning me
to follow the strange little bug creatures/beetle thingies. That
soundtrack can be downloaded over at
[Incompetech.com](//incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/ "Incompetech")
by searching for `Plans in Motion`, the title.

Anyways, I'm really really looking forward to achieving damehood. The
full game for OS X should be coming out until June, so until then, I
guess I'll just be fan girling or what have you.

Can't wait!
