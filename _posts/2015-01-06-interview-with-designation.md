*Will was a great interviewer. He is a really lively guy who knows how
to communicate a lot of information in a fun way. Kudos to Will.*



**1. Yield rate - out of the applicants you accept, what percentage of
that end up attending?**

A third and half end up attending. Some qualities are looked for
specifically in each applicant that we think will contribute to the best
sort of class experience.



**2. How many drop out after simply experiencing the pre-work? How much
time should I dedicate to the pre-work?**

No one has dropped out yet. The average student needs 25 hours per week
in pre-work.



**3. How many college students have you had in the past?**

The typical age of participants: mid–20's - 25, 26 - with a couple of
years of experience. Some are quite a bit older and want to transition
careers or are coming to learn more technological aspects of design.
There has been someone from CMU that took a semester off and attended
Designation over the summer as well.



**4. What kind of process do your instructors go through?**

All evening instructors have been with us since the beginning. All are
very familiar with the content and building the curriculum was a very
collaborative process. As much as I'm an okay coder, we wanted to bring
in people who knew more about the aspects that others weren't that good
in. So we work with instructors to nail our instructions down, so the
assignments can be changed and developed over time. There is a lot of
feedback interchanging between founders and instructors - definitely a
dialogue.



**5. What is your background? How were you introduced into the tech/web
development scene?**

All throughout school, I was in food service. Working in copyright,
video editing, and advertising for about 5 years. I like advertising and
I think it's in a weird kind of state now (symptomatic of something
larger). Advertising connects us to new ideas and experiences which
props up the entertainment industry. It's the reason I got into
Designation. My role as an admissions officer involves me interacting
with comically large wide range of experiences and places from all
around the world (from just about every continent now). Each applicant
is different, but they all tell me that handful of stories (let's say
they're early 30's or late 20's): *"I'm making money, but I still wake
up and am not doing what I'm supposed to."* or *"There's something else
I wanted to do and I want to, in a relatively short time, dramatically
change my skill set."* Millennials, especially, they want to be
creative. I got involved and co-founded this program because I felt the
same way at some point, because even though I was doing something
creative and felt I wasn't doing things that weren't being used at my
old job - it just seemed like something fun to do.
`Will is really an interesting guy!`



**6. What do you guys recommend students do outside of the course?**

The program is 70 hours a week. There is no time outside of the course.
It will be your life for a few months. The boot camp philosophy is that
you have a short amount of time and you do it day in and day out for the
time you're here. In Chicago - there's a lot of Meetups. People who come
from out-of-town can really focus on the program because there are fewer
distractions.



**7. Do you think an undergrad graphic design major can benefit from
your program?**

I think an undergrad student can benefit. In most graphic design
curriculums there is heavy emphasis on print design and students are not
ready to make interesting and engaging websites. Frequently, colleges
are not incentivized in all disciplines to stay modern. Print design is
an important skill to have, if all you are is a print designer, but it's
not where most of the best work is done. Technology is always evolving -
there's always something new. But there has been no major evolution in
print design curriculum, so grads won't be ready. If we want to change
the curriculum, we can. We have no one to answer to except ourselves and
the happiness of our students. That's what distinguishes ourselves from
alternative options. `SO ON POINT!`



**8. What are the backgrounds of the students overall?**

1/3 of our alumni have some amount of professional design experience -
and they're in their mid to late 20's, but they are not doing the kind
or quality of work they want to do. Next 1/3 of our alumni are in their
late 20's all the way up to late 50's. They haven't had much experience
with creative fields or web dev. Then the last 1/3 of our alumni are
students, recent college grads, and miscellanies.
`I really love how knowledgable Will is!`
