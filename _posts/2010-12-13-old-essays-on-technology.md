> This first essay talks about the mainly negative impact of texting on relationships. This essay was finished December 13, 2010. I wrote this for an application to the VA Governor's School for MST (Math, Science, and Technology) for the following summer but alas I was not accepted.

## How Texting Has An Impact On Relationships

First came long letters, then phone calls, then emails, and now it has come to texting...what's now considered haven for many unreserved individuals today as they dwell in company of fingers into the evermore transfiguring sphere of growing technological society. Perhaps not. Limiting themselves with texting potential, they suffer progression into deeper levels of communication.  Positively speaking, however, in whichever situation, texting or email can provide portals of connection for many busy, young, shy, or even hesitant people, placing them in effortless and comfortable zones where rejection becomes bearable.  In darker light, texting can generate sleep deprivation among other unhealthy side effects, exchange numerous conflicting messages, and decrease sincereness in significant relationships.

If you're always on the run, keeping in touch is as easy as 1,2,3...or less. Texting, then, is extremely suitable for following up with someone you just met with upfront messages. Especially if there's intriguing interest and they wish to meet in person later. Both persons reap in benefits as there's no longer any constraint of being pressured to reply within short amounts of time, as with phone calls.  Taking set times aside for phone conversations becomes unnecessary and is replaced with simple but very straightforward texts. All vexing phrases, redundancies, pleonasms, and awkward silences are put to abrupt ends. Discreteness is always an asset. Texting allows people to maintain suitable means of communication when voice calls are either out of the question, intolerable or simply unfeasible. It's extremely portable so people can take cell phones with them absolutely everywhere without the necessity of the internet or having to visit anybody since they can instantly text. If someone knows they're going to be a few minutes late, no problem, text messaging can take care of it. If someone wants to set up a date, no problem. If someone is in a theater and their obsessive mother wants to contact them, no problem. If someone gets rejected or becomes too pursuing, no problem, just ignore or delete and it is done. Like a Big Mac from McDonald's drive-thru windows, texting can offer instant satisfaction wherever and whenever, ultimately where men and women can foster and manage relationships.

Unfortunately, texting has more disadvantages to every twist. There can always be various types of exaggerated thoughts. If texts end up too long and irrelevant, there's favorable chances that other person will retreat from the hassle and discontinue communication. Over-texting can be troublesome for it can be wrongly interpreted as overanxious or even desperate. In which case is never great in blossoming relationships either. If relationships begin and end in circles around cell phone digits, it was never a practical relationship at the start. Face to face contact is necessary for relationships to move to next levels as this provides intimate and deeply emotional connection. Many even find it offensive if they are asked out or dumped through texting which makes sense, considering lengthy or uncomfortable explanations are uncalled for. Texting and driving produce issues. If someone becomes too reliant on texting, introvert behavior may result. Phone theft and technical accidents can occur. Sleep becomes uncommon due to late nights staying up texting. Spending too much money more than really knowing because of addiction is extremely problematic.  Every text sent is always going to be less personal and emotional than if it was done by face to face or phone. Sarcasm along with any other types of tones are not easily interpreted by the text, leading to meshed signals. A recipe for disaster it seems.

In short, although texting has few noteworthy merits with a faster more undemanding technique of conveyance, it precipitates more drawbacks than needed and is not recommended to advance fully in crucial bonding.
