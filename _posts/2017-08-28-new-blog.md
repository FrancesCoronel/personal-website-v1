## I know what you're thinking... 💭

What's with the creepy banner image? 👻

Well, here's the thing.

At the beginning of this year, I decided to say goodbye to Wordpress and migrate my blog to something faster and with less restraints (*cough* static site generators *cough*)

Something like Jekyll.

Like so slow it makes me cringe inside.

Here's an example of what the hell I'm taking about.

It took 87 seconds to serve my shitty website up?? REALLY? 😔

Like that's really intense. I have less than 110 blog posts!!

So yeah, that's where my mind state is these days. 😪
