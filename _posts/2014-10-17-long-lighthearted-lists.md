### Languages I've Been Seriously Exposed To

![](//www.clker.com/cliparts/5/9/c/2/1194984395619889880earth_globe_dan_gerhrads_01.svg.med.png)

> These are listed in chronological order.

1. Spanish
    -   Soy Peruana.
2. English
    -   Born and raised in the US, so there's that.
3. French
    -   I lived in France for about a year in 3rd grade.
4.  Japanese
    -   Was enrolled in the Newport News Japanese school that ran every
        Saturday all throughout middle school.
5.  Swahili
    -   While I was in Tanzania taking a summer course for a month, I
        took Swahili language classes. Plus, everyone in Tanzania speaks
        Swahili so there's that.
6.  Arabic
    -   Took a 1-year intro class my senior year of high school.
7.  German
    -   Studied abroad in Germany for about 4 months for my first
        semester of college.



### Old Science Fair Projects

![](//shaullelementary.oursciencefair.com/doc.ashx?id=1491)

-   7th Grade - February 2007
    -   The Effect of Different Kinds of Music on the Growth of Plants
-   8th Grade - February 2008 - 3rd Place
    -   The hypothesis of an organic ant repellent that can increase the
        death number of ants rather than a pesticide was rejected by the
        results of the experiment. The results rejected the hypothesis
        therefore showing that the pesticide used in the experiment
        (Combat Ant Killer Gel) is still the most effective and
        persistent in getting rid of ants.

### Coding Bootcamp Experiences

![](//cdn.skilledup.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/coding-bootcamp.jpg)

-   May 2013 - I learned about coding bootcamps and what they were. The
    first bootcamps I heard about were App Academy and Dev Bootcamp. I
    then decide I'm not prepared for that sort of thing yet because it
    looked beyond my skills at the time.
-   November 2013 - I decide I'm going to apply to bootcamps and attend
    one over the summer because I feel more prepared for interviewing. I
    then decide I want to attend a bootcamp that focuses on JavaScript
    and/or Python.
-   December 2013 - I apply to the following bootcamps for their full
    time web development sessions for the summer, but was unable to
    (unfortunately) attend any of them because I ended up taking summer
    college classes instead. Here are the bootcamps:
    - [RefactorU](//www.refactoru.com) - Boulder, Colorado
        -   Applied, interviewed, accepted. Had an interesting
            conversation about an array of topics related to AI and the
            technological singularity with
            [Sean](//twitter.com/seandaken "Sean Daken - Twitter").
    - [Bitmaker Labs](//bitmakerlabs.com) - Toronto, Canada
        -   Applied, interviewed, accepted. The people there are SO
            nice - it's ridiculous. I did not feel nervous at all during
            the whole process. You can see more about my Bitmaker
            experience
            [here](/blog/2014/03/12/interview-bitmaker-labs/).
    - [Code Fellows](//www.codefellows.org/ "Code Fellows") -
        Seattle, Washington
        -   I applied for the Front-End Design & Development class in
            Seattle but did not go through with the interview. They
            understood and were pretty nice about it.
    - [Dev Bootcamp](//devbootcamp.com/ "Dev Bootcamp") - Chicago
        -   I applied for their main program at their Chicago site.
            Again, I submitted the application but did not go through
            with the rest.
    - [HackerYou](//hackeryou.com) - Toronto, Canada
        -   Applied, chatted with founder
            [Heather](//twitter.com/heatherpayne "Heather Payne - Twitter"),
            never ended up completing the rest of admissions process,
            but it was still a great chat.
    - [Hackbright Academy](//www.hackbrightacademy.com) - San
        Francisco, CA
        -   Applied, chatted with co-founder
            [Christian](//twitter.com/chriszf "Christian - Twitter")
            and one of the instructors, never ended up completing the
            rest of admissions process.
    - [RocketU](//rocket-space.com/rocketu/ "RocketU") - San
        Francisco, CA
        -   Applied, chatted with one of the admission officers but told
            them early on I would not be completing the process. They
            were very understanding.

    up doing just that! You can find more about that experience
