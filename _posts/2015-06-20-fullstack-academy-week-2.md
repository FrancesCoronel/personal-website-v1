Day One - Monday
----------------

-   I have the whole apartment to myself for this week so it's going to
    a very, very chill environment. JOY.

Day Two - Tuesday
-----------------

-   I've decided I'm just not a big fan of
    [`Codewars`](//codewars.com "Codewars").
-   I just prefer [`Code School`](//codeschool.com "Code School")'s
    cleaner design & fun videos. Oh, well!

Day Three - Wednesday
---------------------

-   Pair programming worked out great today. I'm building web apps
    already! 😁

Day Four - Thursday
-------------------

-   I enjoyed socializing more today.
-   I have slightly more respect for Code School after dealing with
    Treehouse today.
-   Team lunch today. We played UNO and Kevin won. I've decided UNO is
    boring.
-   Finally finished a presentation about cool web dev tips & tricks.
    That took me basically all day.

Day Five - Friday
-----------------

-   People liked the presentation! Yesssss…. :grin:
-   Hot Seat today. I'm really enjoying hearing these stories. If only
    there was some sort of fireplace…
-   Finally gave in and installed `zsh` today using some dude's dot
    files (he's a big Spacegray theme fan too). Now everything looks and
    feels **SPACEGRAY**. Heyyyy.
-   Bought this [Sublime Text Power
    User](//sublimetextbook.com/ "ST3 Power User") book by the Bos
    for `$25`. I used the coupon code `CHRISTMAS` which still worked and
    took `$11` off. LOL.
-   It sucks that [Flavours](//flavours.interacto.net/ "Flavours")
    is no longer going to exist once `El Capitan` comes out. I want to
    be able to customize EVERYTHING.
