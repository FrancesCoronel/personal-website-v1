I have been *quite* the busy bee.

Busy But Happy Bee

To the point where it's actually nothing like the sweet picture above.
It's more like this:

[![Cute But Angry
Bee](//fvcproductions.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/cute-but-angry-bee.png?w=282)](//fvcproductions.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/cute-but-angry-bee.png)

So I'm taking a break and writing about how I've become the annoyed bee
depicted above. It'll allow me to destress for some strange reason.

Since this is going to be a ridiculously long post (playing catch up
here), I've broken it into sections:

1. [The Rant](#section-rant)
2. [The Big Presentation](#section-presentation)
3. [The Foundations](#section-foundations)
4.  [The Numbers](#section-numbers)
5.  [The Journey So Far](#section-journey)

Rant
----

For Weeks 2 and 3, I had to fervently split my time between working on
**Fullstack Foundations** and preparing a **big presentation** for
Goldman Sachs.

But that's not all. Otherwise, I'd still be the first bee. As of now, I
also have to handle the following:

1. Finalizing the website and designing a logoÂ for my first ever
    official client, [Ameot](//www.ameot.com/ "Ameot")
2. Studying for that silly standardized examÂ (sadly, no - I'm actually
    talking about the [GRE](//www.ets.org/gre "GRE")).
3. Taking an online summer course that is a total waste of time but I
    need the course to graduate as a CS major (the course is CSC 120
    which is basically required for all students and learn the ins and
    out of useful things like Microsoft Office, PowerPoint, & Excel,
    among other things). A real joy since I have not seriously used any
    Microsoft products (besides Skype) since the 9th grade.
4.  Staying caught up with [Silicon
    Valley](//www.wikiwand.com/en/Silicon_Valley_(TV_series) "SIlicon Valley").

Thankfully, once summer hits, my only focus will be Fullstack (assuming
I pass the assessment - I suck at those), the GRE, and that summer
course. Not bad.

The Big Presentation
--------------------

I was selected as one of 3 finalists to represent
[BrooklynCupcake](//brooklyncupcake.com "BrooklynCupcake") for the
10,000 Small Businesses Student Challenge through [Goldman
Sachs](//www.goldmansachs.com/ "Goldman Sachs"). I was one out of 9
students presenting since there were 3 students for the three different
small businesses.

This implied that I had to create a 5-minute presentation addressing the
business challenge
[BrooklynCupcake](//brooklyncupcake.com "BrooklynCupcake") wanted
to solve.

Creating the right presentation can take a **whole lot** of time (it
totally did) and I ended up getting a cold from trying to work too hard
(at least that's what my mum claims). I even still had that cold when I
was presenting, but I lucked out and even though I had this sketchy cold
voice the day after the presentation, I managed a softer sexier cold
voice the day of.

Regardless, the hard work paid off and I was selected as the winner for
the [BrooklynCupcake](//brooklyncupcake.com "BrooklynCupcake")
category!

This was the final submission I presented.

With all that being said, what stood out for me the most throughout the
entire trip was how everyone got to work on `200 West Street`. The
Goldman Sachs building/tower is huge so what everybody does is enter
through the first floor, take an elevator to the 11th floor (the Sky
Lobby) and then from there, they have several different elevators they
can use to get to the other floors. There was an elevator hallway for
Floors 12â€“14 for instance and then another for Floors 30â€“40 and so on
and so forth.

Everyone was so used to all the elevators and there were so many people
just packing inside the next available elevator. It felt like something
exciting was always about to happen but at the same time, I felt a lot
like a sardine.

Needless to say, I learned a lot about what kind of environment I'd like
to work in for the future. I have just never been into very big crowdsâ€¦
or (sigh) business suits.

**Anyways**, I'm going to use all `$5K` of what I earned to pay for the
Fullstack Academy tuition, which is going to cover roughly half of it
all.

Foundations
===========

For Part 2 (or Week 2) of Foundations, which was twos week ago (holy
crap!), I did end up finishing the "Guessing Game", which was a lot of
fun.

[![The Guessing
Game](//fvcproductions.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/unknown.png)](//fvcproductions.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/unknown.png)

> You're welcome to play the game at
> [fvcproductions.github.io/Guessing-Game](//fvcproductions.github.io/Guessing-Game/ "Guessing Game").

But now this week is all about **Part 4**, the last part, the finale,
the end game. I still have a lot of crap to do but I have been able to
reach some conclusions.

-   I don't really enjoy Chalkers as a teacher on Treehouse. I'm sorry,
    it may be the British accent, it may not be.
-   As I've stated before, Fullstack doesn't f\*\*\*\* around with their
    pre-work. Well, now that statement is a conclusion.

The Numbers
===========

I'm feeling statistically inclined so I'm going to share some of the
more technical aspects of my experience so far. Mind you, this is more
for my personal benefit than anything so I can look back and (hopefully)
see how I've improved.

> Cost of Fullstack Academy's Summer of Code (I'm part of the 1st
> cohort, y'all!) = `$13,680`

-   4 Weeks for Foundations
-   11 Weeks and 3 Days On Campus
    -   7 \*Â 11 + 3 = **100 Days** of Fullstacking!
    -   Well, technically 100 - 2 \*Â 11 = 78 days of Fullstacking
        because I get weekends off - yay!
-   June 8th to August 26th
-   Mondays through Fridays
-   9 AM to 6:30 PM
    -   9.5 hours, 78 days
    -   741 hours in total
-   There's a `$2,000` discount since the original program is
    `$15,680Â `for 13 Weeks On Campus.
-   **BUT** I'm a **GIRL**! So now it's `$12,680` since ladies all get a
    `$1,000` discount.
-   **BUT** I applied ridiculously early so I got grandfathered into the
    old tuition (which was \$12,500). Thank goodness for that because
    otherwise I'm pretty sure my parents would have been a lot more
    resistant. I saved a lot more this way than with the other discounts
    (`$3,180`).
-   My grand total is now `$9,500` for `741 hours` of in-person JS
    learning! So basically \$13 per hour. Sounds good to me.
    -   That doesn't include Foundations or Flight either.

-   **a Treehouse subscription**
    -   I'm part of the Group plan, and for this year, the group
        currently has 101 signups.
    -   So assuming they're part of the 150 seats plan which is about
        \$19,875 annually (woah), it costs \$11 per month per student.
    -   I actually used to have the student membership which was \$9 a
        month, but it looks like the Group Plan doesn't want to consider
        me a student.
    -   `= around $44 in total for 4 months`
-   **a CodeSchool subscription**
    -   It's \$25 per month per person for the Group Plan, which I'm
        part of.
    -   `= around $100 in total for 4 months`
-   **The Instructors**
    -   The average developer salary is about \$80K in NYC so I'll just
        guess that's how much pay their instructors.
    -   So with that in mind, \$80K/12 month = roughly \$7K and \$7K
        times 4 months = \$28K
    -   However, realistically speaking, I'm really just spending about
        half of that 4 months face to face with the instructor, soâ€¦
    -   `= around $14K in total for 4 months per instructor`
-   **A Supportive Environment**
    -   **Who knows** how much that costs?
    -   Well, what I can do is estimate the cost of the building floor
        itself which is probably around \$250K per year (maybe more). So
        roughly \$21K per monthâ€¦ ergo it's around \$84K in total for 4
        months
    -   However, I don't take up that much space so realistically
        speaking we can split that cost by 70 since that's how many
        people are usually there at any given time - which turns intoâ€¦
    -   `= around $1.2K in total for 4 months per instruc11tor`
-   **Other Stuff**
    -   I'm tired of guesstimating but they probably have to worry about
        the costs for the other software they use (like Learndot whose
        standard plan is \$500/month) throughout the program and
        snacks/snacks to appease the newbie programmers like myself. We
        just :heart: snacks and swag.
    -   Anyways, so going out on a limb here, I'll sayâ€¦
    -   `= around $500 in total for 4 months for other stuff`

So, with all that, we can calculate how much they're really spending on
each student, like me.

-   Treehouse Subscription \$44
-   Code School Subscription \$100
-   The Instructors \$14K
-   A Supportive Environment \$1.2K
-   Other Stuff \$500
    -   Total `$15,844`

Yeah, that looks about right. I got a good deal! :grin:

**HOLD ON NOW.** That doesn't include living and eating and extra
expenses.

-   Subway for 3 Months - `$350`
-   Living with Tio Victor & Tia Ceci - `IDK yet`
-   Food - `$3,500 for 4 months`

So, in total, the program is going to cost me around `$14K`, give or
take.

Now when this all over, I'll abe able to see if I'm any good at
estimating.
