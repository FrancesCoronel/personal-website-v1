Day One - Monday
----------------

-   Creating the live UI for Trip Planner is good since I like my
    partner. We get stuck a lot, but he's super resilient. He even made
    a really cool theme for his that reminded me a lot of Tron Legacy
    (the 1980's version, not the recent one). Nothing like a little
    reminiscing.

![cDock](//www.macupdate.com/images/icons256/51149.png)

-   I'm also really sad
    [`cDock`](//sourceforge.net/projects/cdock/) is probably not
    going to work anymore when
    [`El Capitan`](//www.apple.com/osx/elcapitan-preview/) comes
    out. Along with probably every other customizing app for my Mac I
    use/have used such as [`Flavours`](//flavours.interacto.net/),
    [`Ubersicht`](//tracesof.net/uebersicht/),
    [`LiteIcon`](//www.freemacsoft.net/liteicon/), etc. Such
    sadness.

> Shoot, I'm going to go download the Public Beta now.

Day Two - Tuesday
-----------------

![Beta Day](//i.imgur.com/2zJDhXp.png)

-   I downloaded the Public Beta.
-   The first
    ever [`Fullstack Beta Day`](//www.eventbrite.com/e/fullstack-beta-day-tickets-17673389584) is
    going to be this Saturday! This implies I'll be able to check out
    all the (probably) cool projects the fellows have been working on!
    I'm already pretty excited. Weird.
-   I'm starting to really dislike this Trip Planner project. The code
    is just starting to look more and more gross-looking and I feel lost
    in the sea of (water?) bugs.
-   I miss working with the **"pretty"** stuff.

![Women Who Code
NYC](//photos4.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/9/0/a/8/600_341377032.jpeg)

-   After school today, I went to a
    [`Women Who Code`](//www.meetup.com/WomenWhoCodeNYC/events/220650892/)
    meetup (my first in the NYC area) featuring "Lightning Talks" with
    Jovia and Kelsey. Out of the 5 presentations I was able to see, the
    two best ones were by folks from Fullstack Academy. Not even trying
    to exaggerate or anything, that's just what happened. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯



Day Three - Wednesday
---------------------

![Sockets for the
Win!](//storage.vexxhost.net/v1/d7594b0298b54bcc9e4e0f252e1da2e4/blog/mean-socket-io-integration-tutorial%2Fsocketio-logo.png)

-   Okay, so I feel a little bad saying this, but I'm pretty sure the
    best lecture I've had so far here at Fullstack was just delivered -
    today - by Joe.
-   Joe is going to be teaching us more for the senior phase, but I
    guess since we're all going to be seniors in about a week and a half
    or so, he's trying to get used to us or something.
-   Anywhoozies, the lecture on
    [`Socket.io`](//socket.io/ "Socket.io") was just awesome.
    Seriously. So much mental stimulation. Sockets for the win!
-   It helped that I had a good partner for this workshop too.
-   Another factor to consider was how much trolling one could
    incorporate into the workshop which was all about creating a
    white-board (to draw on) anyone could connect to and making sure the
    drawings of everybody else also persisted upon refreshing the
    browser. My partner and I breezed through this workshop so yeah, we
    were feeling pretty confident. 😎😎😎



Day Four - Thursday
-------------------

> SO MANY NICE THINGS HAPPENED TODAY.

So I'm just going to list them off one by one.

#### 1. Angular.js comes to me more easily than most other concepts I've been working with, so I already heart you Angular, you sneaky devil! May you never disappoint me.

![AngularJS](//prerender.io/img/angularjs.jpg)

#### 2. I had a good partner today too so that helped, obviously.

> to work with for the capstone more easily. Hmmm, yessss.

![My impression of pair
programming](//codurance.com/assets/img/custom/blog/muppetspairprogramming.jpg)

#### 3. The learning team lunch was today, so of course I spent most of it LMFAO. Like the real VP.

#### 4. I found out about the new emoji reactions feature on Slack and that brought a small dose of happiness to my day. Here's us trying it out with Gavin's post. 😝

![Emojiii Reactions](//i.imgur.com/lJxcOh0.png)

#### 5. The workshop was interesting. It was basically all about making a primitive version of [Quizlet](//quizlet.com/ "Quizlet"), or maybe what was probably a lot like the very 1st version of Quizlet.

#### 6. Lady's Lunch was today.

Day Five - Friday (And Some of Saturday Too)
--------------------------------------------

![Code
School](//ambassador-api.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/portal/655/2014_09_16_20_43_07_Logo-horizontal.png)

-   Easy cruising through the lecture and workshop on Angular Directives
    today - going through the relevant course material on `Code School`
    really helped out. Why are you so wonderful `Code School`?!
-   Hot Seat today made me feel really sad/frustrated for some reason
    (still not sure why exactly either…). I even had to watch TV
    afterwards to numb my mind for said reason. It was strange, to say
    the least.


> That's [Seema](//twitter.com/seemaisms) talking about
> **`Big O`l** important stuff such as trees. But the binary kind. 🌳💻🌳

-   Then **Saturday** came around and it was finally Beta day! [Michael
    Bae](//twitter.com/michaelbbae) explaining how he blotched his
    mobile app project was probably one of the most entertaining
    presentations I've seen in a bit. I had to leave early to get to my
    hip hop class (so intense!), so I'll have to see what happened after
    the fellow presentations.
-   So that was that. My week ended up with me dancing to Rihanna, just
    like every other week (no, not really). My instructor today had even
    decided to use the one song I had been obsessing over for a while.
    Good times!
