Because of how busy I've been, I haven't really been able to
get into the proper mood to be able to blog about such and such.

As a result, there are now only **7** days of
[**Fullstack**](//www.fullstackacademy.com) left.

> Yup, just **7 MORE DAYS**.

**WHATTTTTTTTTTTTTT.**

We have now gone 3 weeks back in time, all the way back to the beginning of my senior phase here at Fullstack, otherwise known as Week 7.
-----------------------------------------

Monday
------

-   Omg, stackstore. `stress++;`
-   My presentation was shared with the junior cohort! `ego++;`

> Here is the presentation in its full glory:



//speakerdeck.com/fvcproductions/awesome-web-dev-tips-and-tricks



-   1st `REACTO` today. `stress++;`

Tuesday
-------

-   I'm coming to realize that my team is actually very solid. This is
    great! `ego++; stress--;`
-   Learning Team Lunch today. For the first time ever, we have to talk
    to each other and are not actually spending time playing some sort
    of board game.
    -   The meeting is very **hogwarts** (which sounds a lot like
        **awkward** if you say it out loud a bunch of times really
        fast). `excitement--;`

Wednesday
---------

-   Interfeud today! Intefeud is this fun little game where we get
    quizzed on knowledge we learned from Junior Phase. `excitement++;`

Thursday
--------

-   I see my fellow Jimmy on the subway.
-   Yeah, I guess that's basically it.

![TrollForJimmy](//cdn2.scratch.mit.edu/get_image/gallery/221290_200x130.png?v=1371781049.0)

-   `ego++;`

Friday
------

-   Ladies lunch was today, I went briefly, and found out that the
    junior cohort now has the best women-to-men ratio by far.
    -   That ratio fact alone is pretty great.
    -   I also got a lot of nice feedback for the slide deck that was
        shared. `ego++; excitement++;`
-   Fullstack Mixer today.
    -   My learning team combined with one of the junior learning teams
        ended up winning. `excitement++; ego++;`
    -   The grand prize? Stickers.\
        `excitement--;`
-   I completely and utterly embarrassed myself trying to be novel and
    introduce myself with this speech I memorized (refer to speech
    below). `ego -= 5;`


//www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQpGwnN3dfc



-   Here's the first tidbit of the speech (the entire thing is kind of
    long). This is all from memory because the speech is just *that*
    provocative to me.

> T.E Lawrence, eponymously of Arabia, but very much an Englishman,
> favored pinching a burning match between his fingers to put it out.
>
> When asked by his colleague, William Potter, how was he so effectively
> able to put out the match without physically hurting himself
> whatsoever, Lawrence just smiled and replied, ‘The trick, Potter, is
> not minding it hurts.'
>
> The flame that danced at the end of the match was a gift given to us
> by the Titan Prometheus.
>
> It was a gift he stole from the gods and when they found out, well, I
> suppose you could say they overreacted a little.
>
> The poor man was tied to a rock as an eagle swooped down and ripped
> through his belly to pick at his liver, day after day, night after
> night, over and over - each moment brining fresh, excruciating pain.
>
> All this because he gave us fire.
>
> Our first true piece of technology.
>
> Fire.

-   In my head, I was thinking this is how the speech was going to go
    since I practiced and such:

![MinionsSpeech](//33.media.tumblr.com/8642075103c54ee6eae9bb3808377121/tumblr_noenylQkFh1s8njeuo1_500.gif)

-   But in reality, when I tried to speak it out, my entire face started
    to almost melt and I felt this strange sense of uncertainty all
    throughout.
    -   It was interesting going through this process because people
        have told me I have pretty solid public presentation skills, and
        here I was, struggling like a true turnip.
    -   In other words, it was a **major reality check.**\
        `goals.push(" improve public speaking skills (perhaps through Toastmasters?)");`

> Short trip this time. ;)



-   **Week 8**
    -   More REACTO.
    -   Presented Stackstore on Wednesday.
    -   On Wednesday, I also presented my Tech Talk on Design.
        Multitasking is fun. -\_\_\_\_\_- That was sarcasm, by the way.
    -   Started working on my Stackathon project. I decide I'm going to
        take it easy for this one, because I'm tired and we only have
        till Monday to work on it, so *ughhhhh*.

> Yawn.



-   **Week 9**
    -   On Monday, I get an invitation to attend an Apple Hiring Event
        back in Norfolk. I applied for an College At Home Advisor
        position back on July 4th, so I'm really glad they were able to
        follow back. The event is on Sunday.
    -   We also present our stackathon projects on Monday.
        -   My stackathon project was **[Rank
            Me](//github.com/fvcproductions/RankMe)**, an app that
            ranks coding bootcamps on their rating and social scores
            based on data that is crawled from various sites.
        -   I bothered Jimmy a lot to get my crawler working nicely.
            Thanks Jimmy!
        -   The app is still very much in *BETA*, but once I settle back
            home, I'll **definitely** have something to work on because
            I've had this idea ever since I first started applying to
            bootcamps, which was back in friggin' 2013. It's going to be
            big, y'all.
    -   I come to realize that I still haven't gotten my 2 extra
        **free** t-shirts from Fullstack for (1) making a killer design
        for that flashcard app from Junior Phase with Yves and (2) for
        getting to 4 kyu on Codewars. :(
    -   There is **A LOT** of planning done in preparation for the
        groups pairing off for the Capstone projects. If the point was
        to emphasize what a big deal it was, point successfully
        emphasized!
    -   After a lot of discussion about ideas, I decide to hop on to
        David's idea of creating an internal sort of LinkedIn for
        Fullstack Academy students and companies that are looking to
        hire them.
        -   It seems very practical and I actually was thinking of this
            as a potential project myself when looking at bootcamps to
            attend.
        -   I had really wanted a place to go to for Fullstack Academy
            where I could explore all the hackathons, projects, and
            companies students are involved with.
        -   And so now I can at least start putting the seed in the
            ground for this project per se since it'll be continually
            developed and improved upon within Fullstack regardless.

> Time travel wasn't even that necessary this time, but hey. 8-)



-   **Week 10**
    -   As it turns out, there are only 2 people in my group for the
        capstone project (which has now been dubbed `Hiredot2` because a
        previous Hiredot existed…but died out\[?\]), *myself included*.
        -   Yes, it's actually just Joanna and I.
        -   I've actually mentioned Joanna here on my blog before.
        -   She's the one who attends Cornell Tech for her Master's in
            Connective Media.
        -   In her last year too. Lucky gal.
    -   Anyways, the reason we're just a group of two (and that usually
        never happens with capstone projects but there's definitely been
        some exceptions going on with my cohort because they're trying
        to accommodate the preferences that us Summer of Code (SOC)
        students have) is because (1) we're both SOC students so we're
        obligated to work together and (2) I thought I would have to go
        back home early for further steps in the interview process for
        the Apple College At Home Advisor position.
        -   Turns out though I was totally wrong about that last part
            and I'll definitely be able to finish the program till the
            end.
        -   **However**, Joanna still has to start going back to school
            this Wednesday (today) so she'll only be coming to Fullstack
            part time from then (now) on.
        -   Most people figured at that point that both of us would have
            less time to work on the capstone, so it just ended up being
            the two of us.
        -   Anywhoozies, the point is - it's a tight situation.
    -   I started working on actual code this week for the capstone.
    -   There's more Interfeud. The Flex students end up winning of
        course. :rolleyes:
    -   A lot of the states (hackathons, projects, students, companies)
        are basically done now for `Hiredot2`, but time slots still need
        to be created for the hiring event state and the dragging and
        dropping feature for students and companies.
