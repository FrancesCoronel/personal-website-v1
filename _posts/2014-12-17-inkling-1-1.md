1.1 How does one describe themselves?
-------------------------------------

Here's my take on it: give concrete examples of who you are, because
everything else bases itself on perspective and is therefore relative
and interchangeable.



### The Reasoning

For example, in my case I can use the following terms to describe
myself:

    * atheist
    * vegetarian
    * female

These kind of descriptions can't really be disputed, unless perhaps
you're some kind of religious, food, gender, or age extremist; in which
case, I suppose everything is still up for grabs. These terms are
*pretty* clearly defined and up for little dispute about what they can
imply.

An atheist is simply one who does not believe in god, a vegetarian is
one who does not eat meat, and a female is one who is not a male. Pretty
obvious to anybody who comes across these terms about what they imply.

*On the other hand*, if I used the following terms to describe myself:

    * ambitious
    * dog-lover
    * good at programming in [so and so]

Well, then, it's not very clear how each term is being defined.

Ambition is always defined by the person and their own ambitions and the
adjective ambitious is relative.

Dog-lovers - well there are extreme ends. There are those that claim
themselves dog-lovers and like to think they love dogs but to others
they are not even very capable of raising a dog. I remember a neighbor
coming up to me when my dog, Nefer, was barking outside while I was with
Nefer and since I like hearing my dog bark sometimes, I didn't really
stop her from barking. The neighbor told me that wasn't the way dogs
ought to be raised and that if I loved my dog, I would train her better.
So perhaps to her, I wasn't the definition of what a dog-lover is. An
**exaggerated example** of this is calling someone who eats dog a
dog-lover. In one sense, it's fair to say they are dog lovers because
they love eating dog. In another sense, it doesn't make any sense at all
and actually makes me want to tingle in utter repulsion. *Ahhh,
perspective.*

Good at programming — well, that's just a loaded phrase. Okay, first
off, who's really good at programming anyhow? The only thing I've
learned for sure in my experience with technology and development so far
is actually a concept somewhat outside the realm of technology and that
is [the Socratic
Paradox](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_know_that_I_know_nothing) -
knowing ‘I know one thing: that I know nothing' - BAM.

I suppose, yes, you could apply the Socratic Paradox to most fields, but
with technology, this idea just slaps everybody in the face all the
time. Technology is this ever-changing catalyst of change in itself
(which is just a silly phrase, I know) and by next year if you haven't
committed yourself to continuously learning, you'll simply be left
behind. That's what I love about the field. No one can really say
they're a pro but if they are in fact considered to be a pro, then they
still have to constantly develop themselves to keep that position.

And it's this *mentality of being addicted to constant improvement* that
I feel is very celebrated among great developers in general too.

I mean, how many new applications have you found out about this year
alone? How many of them do you now use on a daily basis? It's probably
at least a few (for me, it's a lot). And inevitably, all this
information is just going to keep increasing around us at this
exponential rate and it's weird and scary, but it's mostly just amazing.
This is old repeated news of course but hey.

> *Hmm, so I realize I'm going off a tangent here…*



### So in conclusion…

When you're describing yourself in non-concrete terms, make sure to show
why you're \[so and so\] and not merely proclaiming it. If you believe
yourself to be ‘humble', define what humility is to you and how you've
been humble in a certain life situation.

It sounds like common sense but there are those that find it ideal to
spew a bunch of random adjectives without giving much meaning or
background behind these adjectives and that in itself is just not very
ideal.
