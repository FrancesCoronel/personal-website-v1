Peter Weyland has been a magnet for controversy since he announced his
intent to build the first convincingly humanoid robotic system by the
end of the decade.

Whether challenging the ethical boundaries of medicine with
nanotechnology or going toe to toe with the Vatican itself on the issue
of gene-therapy sterilization, Sir Peter prides himself on his motto,
"If we can, we must." After a three-year media blackout, Weyland has
finally emerged to reveal where he's heading next. Wherever that may be,
we will most certainly want to follow.

Conceived and designed by Ridley Scott and Damon Lindelof and directed
by Luke Scott.
