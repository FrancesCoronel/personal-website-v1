So if you're not already familiar with Robert Green's popular book "[The 48 Laws of Power](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_48_Laws_of_Power "48 Laws of Power - Wiki")" that was published in 1998, I'm going to suggest you read it… right now.

Like any popular book, it has its positive and negative criticisms, but I found it immensely interesting for a self-help book.

I felt some of the laws mentioned had some real merit so I decided to go ahead and share some of them to let you decide yourself.

All credit goes to Robert Greene for the laws.

I just included my 20 favorite ones so that if you want to read the book, you can still get surprised.

Here they are then…

1. Never Outshine The Master
2. Be Wary Of Friends For They Will Betray You Faster
3. Learn How To Use Enemies For They Have More to Prove
4. Conceal Your Emotions
5. Always Say Less Than Necessary
6. Never Do Yourself What Others Can Do For You
7. Use Selective Honesty & Generosity
8. Crush Your Rival Completely & Totally
9. Be Unpredictable
10. Isolation is Dangerous
11. Do Not Offend The Wrong Person
12. Keep Your Own Hands Clean
13. Plan Ahead To The End
14. Make Any Accomplishment Seem Effortless
15. Play Along
16. Discover Weaknesses
17. Think Differently, Behave Commonly
18. Despise Anything Free
19. Respect Tradition While Slowly Implementing Reform
20. Adapt and Survive
