        enough for people with a bit of background in programming

    -   The admissions officer for this program, Will, is really cool.
        He's just so full of zest. I'd definitely recommend this program
        to people interested in graphic design because at the least,
        they can meet Will. Haha.

> Even though [Treehouse](//teamtreehouse.com/) wasn't listed since

> School](//www.codeschool.com/) for slightly more advanced users.
> The breadth of what Treehouse offers is pretty neat.
