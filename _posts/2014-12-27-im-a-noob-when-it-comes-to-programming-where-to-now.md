Here, I've compiled a list of 15 great resources I've come to learn about over the years of trying to learn how to properly program.
====================================================================================================================================

### I still consider myself a *noob* now (I mean, it's only been 3 years!), but I grow more and more comfortable with the idea that I've never going to know everything and that aspiring to be a great programmer is the same as aspiring to improve yourself constantly everyday in the art. It's what I love about the field and so I hope this list helps you out in your journey into the realm of digital hieroglyphics (as I like to call it) too.

15. [HTML & CSS](//www.htmlandcssbook.com)\

    > uninspiring, but they do not need to be. We wanted to redesign the
    > tech book and make it more accessible, relevant, and attractive to
    > a whole new group of readers. The result is a book that feels more
    > like a magazine and is enjoyable to flick through, and looks like
    > it belongs in the graphic design section rather than the
    > programming section of a bookstore.
