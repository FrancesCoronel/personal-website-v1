## Generally speaking, I enjoy mentoring on how to prepare for coding bootcamps but I have teachable experience in web development, web design, and all sorts of nifty dev, design, or productivity tools.

So far, I’ve helped out folks who have successfully gone on to coding bootcamps like [Fullstack Academy](https://fullstackacademy.com), [Hack Reactor](https://hackreactor.com), and [MakerSquare](https://makersquare.com).

I’ve also tutored kids at the elementary, middle, and high school level on how to get started in the tech field.

> As of **May 2017**, I’ve dedicated **over 55 hours** of my free time mentoring awesome people.

Feedback from my mentoring sessions can be found in the [feedback section](https://fvcproductions.com/reviews/) of my website.

### If you’re interested in being mentored, please feel free to [contact me](https://fvcproductions.com/contact) through my website. 📨

A list of **all** of my mentoring sessions can be found in the Airtable below.
